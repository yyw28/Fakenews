100percentfedUp.com ; Talk about covering your ass! Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to Iran‚Ä¶Corrupt to the core! Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration‚Äôs secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has ‚Äúpleaded the Fifth‚Äù Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äôs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. 
The response from the attorney general‚Äôs office is ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to ‚Äúessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the world‚Äôs foremost state sponsor of terrorism,‚Äù Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch.

Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: ‚Äúre-opened‚Äù) the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: 
And the news is breaking while we‚Äôre on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn‚Äôt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. 
Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner‚Äôs well-known penchant for lying, it‚Äôs hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms ‚Äî and, as Wallace indicated on this morning‚Äôs show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway.

Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up "	bias

NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Ä¶Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Ä¶Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email server last week. 
‚ÄúBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,‚Äù Prince claimed. 
‚ÄúThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to go public with this if you don‚Äôt reopen the investigation and you don‚Äôt do the right thing with timely indictments,‚Äô‚Äù Prince explained. 
‚ÄúI believe ‚Äì I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ‚Äì the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äôve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That‚Äôs the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,‚Äù Prince said. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,‚Äù Prince declared. 
Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. 
‚ÄúNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,‚Äù Prince elaborated. ‚ÄúWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äì the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äì have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Prince contended. 
‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,‚Äù he stated. 
‚ÄúSo the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs ‚Äì that‚Äôs the level just below commissioner ‚Äì he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,‚Äù Prince said. 
He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ‚Äúbut they can‚Äôt convene a grand jury. They can‚Äôt file charges.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúNow, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he‚Äôs a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.‚Äù 
Marlow agreed that Bharara‚Äôs ‚Äústerling reputation‚Äù as a determined prosecutor was ‚Äúbad news for the Clintons.‚Äù 
Prince agreed, but said, ‚ÄúIf people are willing to bend or break the law and don‚Äôt really care about the Constitution or due process ‚Äì if you‚Äôre willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone ‚Äì who knows what level of pressure‚Äù could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
Listen to interview here: 
‚ÄúThe point being, fortunately, it‚Äôs not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,‚Äù Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ‚Äúexposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department‚Äù against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ‚Äúkeep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,‚Äù he warned. 
As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ‚Äúde Blasio wants to stay away from this.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,‚Äù he said.

To All Members of the University Community: 
As I‚Äôm sure many of you did, I watched the election coverage late into the night, and had the opportunity to visit with students and staff at a results-watching event sponsored by the Ginsberg Center at the Michigan Union. It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterday‚Äôs election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äì and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. ¬∑ Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hall‚Äôs Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. ¬∑ Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. ¬∑ The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Union‚Äôs Willis Ward Lounge.

I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people.

Trump‚Ä¶it turns out Trump was right‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äònever Trumpers‚Äô from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äôs popular vote ‚Äî which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Äì and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äôs 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Äî Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Äî Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äôs more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äôs 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äôs biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äôs most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äôs most critical battleground states. Let‚Äôs look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äôt yet final because not all precincts have reported.

He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he‚Äôd like to, ‚Äúpunch him in the face.‚Äù Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America.

Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday‚Äôs election, he replied: ‚ÄúYes, absolutely. Things aren‚Äôt being done right.‚Äù 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday.

No, it‚Äôs not awful. It‚Äôs great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It‚Äôs also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. 
First of all, she‚Äôs probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
States don‚Äôt count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn‚Äôt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren‚Äôt counted. 
Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore ‚Äúwon‚Äù the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California‚Äôs uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore‚Äôs 500,000 popular vote ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You‚Äôre kidding.) 
Getting back to the ‚Äúwin the popular vote/lose the Electoral College‚Äù scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. 
But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. 
Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country‚Äôs entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. ‚Äì American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!"	bias

Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn‚Äôt get the memo‚Ä¶Trump‚Äôs tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, ‚ÄúThere will never be a President Trump‚Äù. 
Perhaps Amal should‚Äôve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns‚Ä¶ 
Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump‚Äôs proposals would be ‚Äòviolations of international law.‚Äô 
Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America‚Äôs reputation under the real estate mogul‚Äôs plans. 
She noted that Trump‚Äôs comments during his campaign, ‚Äòthat there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed ‚Äî all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.‚Äô 
The 38-year-old wife said America‚Äôs reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
‚ÄòI think there‚Äôs some concern from abroad as to, ‚ÄúAre these things actually going to happen?‚Äù, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,‚Äô according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation‚Äôs security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us‚Ä¶ 
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
‚ÄòWhen you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‚ÄòThey only want jihad.

They had to know they had it coming‚Ä¶ 
Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record Trump Tower sitdown on Monday, sources told The Post. 
‚ÄúIt was like a f‚Äìing firing squad,‚Äù one source said of the encounter. 
‚ÄúTrump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‚ÄòI hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,‚Äô ‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,‚Äù the source added. 
A second source confirmed the fireworks. 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,‚Äù the other source said. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.‚Äô He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúTrump didn‚Äôt say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ‚Äì which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.‚Äù 
The stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. 
‚Äú[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ‚ÄòHow do you propose we the media work with you?‚Äô Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ‚ÄòHow are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down: 
Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks,‚Äù she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. ‚ÄúPretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù 
The meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations. 
The hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz,

Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they‚Äôre the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. 
Trump supporters are taking Trump‚Äôs call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them ‚Äî all of which are illegal. 
But, Trump‚Äôs deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as ‚ÄúVote Protectors.‚Äù 
The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. 
According to the Huffington Post , 
Stone‚Äôs group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake ‚Äúexit polls,‚Äù efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that‚Äôs what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group‚Äôs websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. 
In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a ‚Äúbad idea‚Äù and ‚Äúordered them taken down.‚Äù 
Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,‚Äù she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. ‚ÄúWhen that‚Äôs being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.‚Äù 
Indeed, but that‚Äôs exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. 
As it turns out, he‚Äôs right about the election being rigged, only it‚Äôs conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. 
Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. 
‚ÄúI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,‚Äù Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. 
‚ÄúUWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn‚Äôt going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.‚Äù 
So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. 
And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump‚Äôs deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump‚Äôs people try to say he doesn‚Äôt want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump‚Äôs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
‚ÄúThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.‚Äù 
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, ‚Äúwow.‚Äù Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting ‚ÄòJEW-S-A‚Äô at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as ‚Äòdeplorable.‚Äô She responded: 
‚ÄúYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe ‚Äî I hope you‚Äôve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you‚Äôve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he‚Äôs had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.‚Äù 
Tapper went on to say that no, he isn‚Äôt putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway‚Äôs hand on this one: 
‚ÄúBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,‚Äù Tapper continued. ‚ÄúHe just has. He says things like, ‚ÄúOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.‚Äô But he has never serious said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.‚Äô He has never seriously done it.‚Äù 
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
‚ÄúI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we‚Äôre actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we‚Äôre going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.‚Äù 
No, Kellyanne, it‚Äôs not a sign that Trump is winning. It‚Äôs pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it‚Äôs all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he‚Äôs one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable supporters aren‚Äôt waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They‚Äôve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is ‚Äúrigged‚Äù in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump‚Äôs stupid hats and a ‚ÄúDeplorables‚Äù T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don‚Äôt apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer‚Äôs hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
‚ÄúIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who‚Äôs probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,‚Äù local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . ‚ÄúI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they‚Äôre going to vote and so there‚Äôs nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump‚Äôs supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won‚Äôt hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt rent to the n-word,‚Äù and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump‚Äôs run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a ‚ÄúC‚Äù on the documents for ‚Äúcolored,‚Äù and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs involvement with his father‚Äôs business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father‚Äôs $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization‚Äôs history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away ‚Äì it‚Äôs still there.

We‚Äôve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It‚Äôs a life most of us can never imagine while we‚Äôre paying our monthly bills. So what‚Äôs it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star‚Äôs son wasn‚Äôt what one might imagine. Or, given Trump‚Äôs temperament, it might be exactly what you‚Äôd imagine. 
On Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump‚Äôs son had for this father. 
‚ÄúI was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.‚Äôs room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son‚Äôs door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúThere were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.‚Äù 
Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. 
‚ÄúWithout saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said ‚Äúput on a suit and meet me outside,‚Äù and closed the door,‚Äù Melker wrote. 
‚ÄúDonald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHe absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was ‚ÄúDiaper Don,‚Äù because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people‚Äôs beds and urinate.‚Äù ‚ÄúI always felt terrible for him,‚Äù he continued. 
Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because ‚Äúin light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.‚Äù 
To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump‚Äôs son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker‚Äôs story is accurate or not, we‚Äôre not sure, but given Trump‚Äôs awful temper, it‚Äôs difficult to discount it.

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline ‚Äì and even bigoted ‚Äì stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect ‚Äúdeportation forces‚Äù to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. 
According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump‚Äôs wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor‚Äôs visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: 
‚ÄúAs a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.‚Äù 
Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn‚Äôt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management ‚Äì a modeling agency. Also, there‚Äôs the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor‚Äôs visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania‚Äôs wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . 
The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the ‚Äúother.‚Äù Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn‚Äôt completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that it‚Äôs far too much to give them. 
A 56-year-old man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought they‚Äôd damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. 
The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn‚Äôt find Kubek at his home ‚Äì however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter 
The News-Herald reported: 
‚ÄúThe officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù 
In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.‚Äù 
Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt ‚Äúoutnumbered‚Äù by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn‚Äôt be trusted with firearms! Kubek‚Äôs hearing is scheduled for December 5th ‚Äì let‚Äôs hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. You can watch a report below:

Appearing at a concert for Hillary Clinton in Ohio alongside Chance the Rapper, Big Sean and her husband Jay Z, Beyonc√© let us all know why she‚Äôs ‚Äúwith her.‚Äù 
After explaining that she was so happy her nephew got to have Barack Obama to look up to and know he could one day be president, Beyonc√© then explained that this election is continuing on that path of progress. She explained that gender goes beyond that of any religion or race, and electing the first woman president is something she wants for her daughter. She said: 
‚ÄúI want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.‚Äù 
Electing Hillary Clinton would break the mold of the United States being led by only men since its inception. However, that‚Äôs clearly not the only reason to elect Hillary. She is, by far, the most qualified person to run for President of the United States in more than a century.

Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn‚Äôt hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star ‚Äòs Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump‚Äôs lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump‚Äôs speeches. They‚Äôre not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she‚Äôs actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. 
The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton‚Äôs policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton‚Äôs record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons‚Äô corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump‚Äôs endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama‚Äôs record, The campaign, Russia, Trump‚Äôs record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton‚Äôs health and Government corruption. 
They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, ‚ÄúThe electoral system is rigged.‚Äù Of course, it‚Äôs rigged against him: 
‚ÄúAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. ‚ÄòRigged‚Äô became his catchword. 
He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired ‚Äòthugs‚Äô to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis ‚Äî cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. 
In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don‚Äôt trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.‚Äù 
Nobody‚Äôs committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. 
Another is, ‚ÄúMuslims are risky.‚Äù This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: 
‚ÄúHis claims that Syrian refugees ‚Äî 99 per cent are Muslim ‚Äî are terrorists plays to the fears of the ‚Äúother,‚Äù even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump‚Äôs claims ‚Äî about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe polls favour Trump.‚Äù Har de har har ‚Äì Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they‚Äôre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: 
‚ÄúIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This ‚Äòpoll denialism‚Äô gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. 
His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling ‚Äî and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
On Oct. 24, he said ‚ÄòI won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.‚Äô In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote ‚Äî and exaggerate ‚Äî those numbers.‚Äù 
But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe failing NYTimes reporters don‚Äôt even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúBy ‚Äòopen borders,‚Äô [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúHillary‚Äôs plan includes an open border with the Middle East.‚Äù Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, ‚Äúa Democrat.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.‚Äù Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran ‚Äú$150 billion‚Äù as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, ‚ÄúIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people‚Ä¶Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.‚Äù Falsely asserted that Clinton has ‚Äúbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.‚Äù Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO ‚Äúobsolete because it doesn‚Äôt cover terror;‚Äù falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn‚Äôt release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him ‚Äúhave been largely debunked.‚Äù Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, ‚ÄúThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.‚Äù Falsely said ‚ÄúI did not. I did not‚Äù to Clinton‚Äôs charge that he thinks Climate change is a ‚Äúhoax perpetrated by the Chinese.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúI was against going into Iraq. And it‚Äôs so well-documented.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúOur taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.‚Äù 
And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he‚Äôll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper‚Äôs lying, and continue to sell the myth that he‚Äôs not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or ‚Äúdeplorable,‚Äù the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. 
It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwin‚Äôs masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnon‚Äôs excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). 
‚ÄúI never use emails,‚Äù Trump says in the cold opener. ‚ÄúI use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It‚Äôs called Twitter.‚Äù 
After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù replies: 
‚ÄúReally? And I‚Äôm still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady.‚Äù 
After a scathing rebuke of the media‚Äôs decision to ignore Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,‚Äù Baldwin says. ‚ÄúI just feel gross all the time about this. Don‚Äôt you all feel gross?‚Äù he added, addressing the audience. 
McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a ‚Äúfriendship montage‚Äù through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. ‚ÄúNone of this would have mattered if you don‚Äôt vote,‚Äù Baldwin says. 
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,‚Äù McKinnon finishes. 
They‚Äôre right."	bias

As if the election of Donald Trump couldn‚Äôt get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation‚Äôs highest court. 
All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. 
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama‚Äôs nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama‚Äôs nominees. I expect them to give Trump‚Äôs nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don‚Äôt honor Trump‚Äôs nominee, you‚Äôre making a huge mistake.‚Äù 
Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. 
Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn‚Äôt even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That‚Äôs far from the ‚Äúfair shake‚Äù Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. 
Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women‚Äôs rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump‚Äôs conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about ‚Äúfair shakes‚Äù before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn‚Äôt even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that‚Äôs exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame.

Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren‚Äôt taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donald‚Äôs Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. 
‚ÄúI could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine,‚Äù Obama told the magazine . ‚ÄúI could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There‚Äôs no legislative authority; you‚Äôre not elected. And that‚Äôs a wonderful gift of freedom.‚Äù 
In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans ‚Äî and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an ‚Äúape‚Äù and a ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot ‚Äî and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate. 
It will get worse before it gets better.

As predicted, Donald Trump‚Äôs victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities. 
And it‚Äôs even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it. 
Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him. This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California pic.twitter.com/gDLKw54Lox 
‚Äî James Thompson (@JETBallin) November 13, 2016 
The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent African-Americans from getting equal rights. 
‚ÄúYou can hang a n****r from a tree / Equal rights he will never see!‚Äù it says. 
The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. 
In the wake of Trump‚Äôs surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results. 
These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains ‚Äúwhite‚Äù or ‚Äúcolored‚Äù at a Florida high school. 
Frankly, there are so many incidents that it‚Äôs difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . 
This is what Trump‚Äôs America looks like and it‚Äôs scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that? Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husband‚Äôs own supporters?

Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn‚Äôt elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it‚Äôs simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there‚Äôs proof. 
The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked ‚ÄúHow likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.‚Äù Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It‚Äôs VERY unlikely that whites aren‚Äôt getting jobs because minorities are, but that‚Äôs not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . 
Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump‚Äôs signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
Post election, this is what the study found: 
The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù that whites can‚Äôt find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don‚Äôt think that. 
More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are ‚Äúviolent.‚Äù 84 percent think that of Muslims. 
Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: 
Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I‚Äôve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots‚Äô claims go unchallenged.

Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women ‚Äúby the pussy‚Äù to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump‚Äôs glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that ‚Äì Trump was bribing the media ‚Äì at least that‚Äôs the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. 
In her memoire ‚ÄúSettle for More,‚Äù which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women ‚Äúfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.‚Äù That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: 
The worst and most controversial of which was this: 
As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn‚Äôt, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
While Kelly couldn‚Äôt speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn‚Äôt work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
‚ÄúThis is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,‚Äù Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, ‚ÄúThis is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.‚Äù 
‚ÄúTrump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,‚Äù she said. 
When it became obvious that some reporters were ‚Äúin the tank‚Äù for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, ‚Äúcertain TV hosts‚Äù would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn‚Äôt identify them by name or media outlet. 
Source: Yahoo 
Kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump‚Äôs treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . 
While bribing journalists isn‚Äôt illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

It‚Äôs a common stereotype that food stamp recipients, and those who abuse it, are black, Hispanic, or any other race but white. According to the USDA in their report for fiscal year 2013, 40% of recipients are white and 26% are black. Courtesy of Travissonno.com 
While the media and America‚Äôs culture will have you believe that black people (or anyone who isn‚Äôt white) account for copious amounts of fraud, there‚Äôs a story breaking that you won‚Äôt hear on Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù anytime soon (or you might, because any chance to crush the SNAP program, they will take). 
According to WCAX News in New York: 
More than 30 people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the North Country. 
Investigators say over the past couple month‚Äôs people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the Old Time Butcher Block store in Brushton. 
Police also say it‚Äôs not the first time the owner of that store, Dennis Sauve, has been charged with allowing such fraud. 
Police say more arrests are expected. 
Now here‚Äôs the kicker: they‚Äôre all white. Brushton, New York, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. Approximately 99.83% of the population is white, and 0.42% are black. These demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , Owsley Country, Kentucky, which is 99.22% white and 95% Republican. Maybe we should investigate them. 
I just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in Brushton. 
According to WPTZ News: 
Police say the arrests are the result of a year-long investigation, initiated by the Franklin County Department of Social Services Fraud Unit. Franklin County District Attorney‚Äôs Office, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance helped with the investigation. 
The store owner, Denis Sauve (also white), has been charged with third-degree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps. 
This really isn‚Äôt a racial issue so much as it is an, ‚ÄúI told you so,‚Äù issue. While the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program, a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the ‚Äúlazy blacks‚Äù who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance. Well, here we are, a major food stamp ‚Äúbust‚Äù and every criminal involved is white.

In reaction to Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency. 
In 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where President Lisa Simpson inherited an economic mess from ‚ÄúPresident Trump.‚Äù Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality. 
Here is The Simpsons new opening with Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard, ‚ÄúBEING RIGHT SUCKS‚Äù: The Simpsons updates its 2000 prediction of a Trump Presidency‚Ä¶ #TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/Myf5rYb9Dj 
‚Äî The Simpsons (@TheSimpsons) November 14, 2016 
Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who‚Äôs not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future‚Äôs looking pretty bleak. 
Here‚Äôs the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump‚Äôs campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump‚Äôs hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we‚Äôve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

It was just a few days ago that Bernie Sanders responded to Trump‚Äôs election win with the perfect message from Democrats. He said : 
‚ÄúIf Donald Trump takes people‚Äôs anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.‚Äù 
And from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters ‚Äî the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a ‚Äúheavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government,‚Äù Sanders said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires.‚Äù With the announcement of Sanders‚Äô new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. He‚Äôs spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders‚Äô presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders‚Äô popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) commented on Sanders‚Äô new responsibility: ‚ÄúWe want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing.‚Äù Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as he‚Äôs been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trump‚Äôs win: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
However, Sanders‚Äô new role is great news for our country, and we know he‚Äôs going to give Trump hell.

Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he‚Äôs only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect. 
On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
Some reporters in attendance were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS‚Äô Norah O‚ÄôDonnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News‚Äô Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC‚Äôs Phil Griffin; and CNN‚Äôs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , ‚ÄúIt was like a f*cking firing squad.‚Äù 
Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.‚Äù 
This claim was backed up by another person, who said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.‚Äù 
This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù 
Disgraceful.

A flash mob of over 150 blacks teens assaulted numerous people on Friday in Philadelphia in an attack that appears to have been racially motivated, and yet the media is silent about this possible motivation. 
LifeZette reports that the racial component of the attack was evident in a Facebook post written by Joe Lauletta , whose daughter, Christina, was attacked by the flash mob on Friday. Lauletta wrote that he received a phone call from Christina, who tearfully explained that she ""was jumped"" and ""beat up pretty bad."" 
""I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game,"" Lauletta wrote. ""This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened."" 
While no bones were broken, Christina was ""badly bruised"" throughout her body, Lauletta said ""it makes me cry just thinking about it."" 
Lauletta's post seemed to indicate the racial aspect of the attack, and on Tuesday he posted on Facebook that ""the FBI is investigating"" and ""are analyzing all video coverage,"" signaling that the FBI is looking into the attack as a hate crime. 
In an interview with the New York Post , Lauletta wouldn't explicitly say the attack was racially motivated but sort of implied it: 
‚ÄúWell, I haven‚Äôt been saying that because everybody is trying to get me to say it and I don‚Äôt know if I want to be that person,‚Äù Lauletta told The Post. ‚ÄúEveryone can draw their own conclusions.‚Äù 
Lauletta said the possibility of the attacks being motivated by race ‚Äì perhaps as a sort of gang initiation ‚Äì was part of the reason why his story was shared so frequently and as far away as Africa. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it spread so fast,‚Äù Lauletta said. ‚ÄúIf you read my Facebook page, everybody‚Äôs saying it.‚Äù 
However, Philadelphia Police Lt. John Stanford insisted to the Post that ""there hasn‚Äôt been any indication that race is involved in this in any shape or form."" 
Even still, the media hasn't reported that the attack is possibly a hate crime, as LifeZette points out: 
Friday violence as teen mob attacks Temple students, police; four arrested,‚Äù read the headline on Philly.com, while the Philly Voice reported ‚ÄúTeens arrested after flash mob leads to assaults on Broad Street.‚Äù The Associated Press headline read: ‚ÄúSTUDENTS BEATEN, HORSE PUNCHED IN MOB ATTACKS AT UNIVERSITY. 
The Washington Post buried the possibility in their story and then dismissed it with Stanford's quote. 
LifeZette also noted that Temple University described the attack as ""a large group of approximately 200 juveniles causing disruption along Broad Street."" 
Maybe Stanford is correct that it was a random attack, or maybe the black flash mob was targeting whites. But there is no doubting the media's hypocrisy: if this were a flash mob of white teenagers that attacked blacks, the media would be screaming about it being a hate crime. But since the incident in Philadelphia does not advance the media's racial narrative, they will not treat it in the same manner. Tags "	bias

30c1112b3299a340290e84998ff3da8d18875402	"Ben Shapiro Destroys John Oliver On Abortion And Trump By: Hank Berrien October 27, 2016 
On Thursday, on his daily podcast, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro decimated HBO host and supposed comedian John Oliver for his comments regarding Donald Trump's comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. 
Shapiro began, ""HBO‚Äôs John Oliver belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. They think that because they share an accent with Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses."" 
He continued: 
So John Oliver does a political show on American politics; he doesn‚Äôt know much about American politics; he doesn‚Äôt know much about politics generally; but he‚Äôs been feted by the media because he‚Äôs a comedian who‚Äôs wildly to the left. So just like President Obama is going to be interviewed by Samantha Bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, (she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine who‚Äôs the least funny person in human history. Both of them I believe, beat Stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships), so Obama‚Äôs going to be on with Samantha Bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortion‚Äôs wonderful. 
John Oliver was ripping on Donald Trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because he‚Äôs British, that means we‚Äôre supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay attention to the Brits. Here‚Äôs John Oliver talking about abortion: 
The screen then showed Oliver pontificating: 
In terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of women‚Äôs bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. So I guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Trump to draw a Fallopian tube, I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a child‚Äôs drawing of a cobra. 
Shapiro fired back: 
Okay. I would hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesn‚Äôt know. Now look, I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasn‚Äôt graphic enough. But let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay? What happens in a late-term abortion, what happens in a late-term abortion, is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay? Not a right-wing pro-life website: americanpregnancy.org: ""The fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. The catheter removes the cerebral material,‚Äù that would be the brains, ‚Äúuntil the skull collapses. The fetus is then completely removed.‚Äù 
Shapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure: 
Okay, that‚Äôs one procedure that‚Äôs used; that‚Äôs ‚Äúdilation and extraction.‚Äù In late-term abortions it usually one of these two; ‚Äúdilation and evacuation‚Äù or ‚Äúdilation and extraction.‚Äù ‚ÄúDilation and evacuation‚Äù: The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they don‚Äôt use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the child‚Äôs body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. 
Then he proceeded to carve up Oliver: 
So I guess that Donald Trump could have been more graphic; I don‚Äôt know that John Oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, I suppose. But this is what they do, laugh it up, ‚ÄúOh, he can‚Äôt draw a Fallopian tube."" 
Okay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let‚Äôs see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. It‚Äôs not waving a magic wand, and it‚Äôs not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. I would like to see that. ""Okay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let‚Äôs see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like."" Ben Shapiro 
Shapiro concluded: 
But of course he‚Äôll never do that, other than, ""It might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe it‚Äôll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina.‚Äù The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable.

On Saturday, former president George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush celebrated their 70th birthdays together in Crawford, Texas. 
President Bush‚Äôs birthday was July 6, and Laura‚Äôs is on November 4. 
Some of the attendees included former commerce secretary Donald Evans, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, and Ross Perot Jr., the son of H. Ross Perot. George Strait performed, and sang ‚ÄúHappy Birthday,‚Äù per People. Typical of Bush‚Äôs down-home style, he wore jeans, a western-style shirt and a prominent belt buckle. 
The dinner included an avocado and grapefruit salad, Mesquite smoked peppered beef tenderloin, Southern fried catfish, roasted corn and poblano pudding, bourbon carrots, and cheddar and black pepper biscuits. The dessert was a Texas chocolate sheet cake. 
Bush also invited guests to his art studio at the ranch, dubbed Studio 43, where he works on his paintings. 
Laura Bush was working as a librarian in the Austin Independent School District when she met George in 1977; their friends Joe and Jan O'Neill invited them to a barbecue. They were married in November 1977 at the First United Methodist Church in Midland, where she had been baptized. She wore a tan, two-toned dress she had bought off the rack. 
George W. Bush later called his proposal to his wife the ""best decision of my life."" Laura, an only child, said she gained ""brothers and sisters and wonderful in-laws"" and made her feel part of the family. Tags "	bias

Remington Research's summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become ""increasingly competitive"": 
Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. 
‚ÄúThe presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen,‚Äù said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group 
Other state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey's announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. 
The fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown ‚Äî Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 
Radio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could ""have a potentially huge impact"" on Election Day: 
Trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It‚Äôs quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump‚Äôs way. But that‚Äôs provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he‚Äôs been prone to do. Then there‚Äôs the matter of Trump‚Äôs emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. 
If Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign‚Äôs final week. The hope is that there‚Äôs enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton‚Äôs corruption than worried about whether Trump‚Äôs fit for office. 
FiveThirtyEight currently has Trump's odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI's re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day. Tags "	bias

Abedin is perhaps Hillary Clinton‚Äôs closest confidante. During the course of the FBI‚Äôs investigation, she spoke with federal agents on several occasions, evading questions and providing only vague answers to direct inquiries. ‚ÄúThe process has begun,‚Äù stated the bureau Sunday in a rather cryptic message, suggesting that Abedin‚Äôs emails will be possibly be examined before election day. Enjoying intimate access to the former secretary of state, Abedin sent several emails through Hillary‚Äôs private server. A few months ago, the FBI explicitly asked Abedin to hand over any information, including emails and devices those emails may be stored in to investigators. It now looks like she failed to comply with the request. In a bizarre twist of events, the FBI found hundreds of thousands of Abedin‚Äôs emails stored on a laptop belonging to her now-estranged husband. The emails were discovered as investigators seized evidence related to a separate investigation regarding an inquiry into disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner‚Äôs possible sexual overtures to a minor. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chats with her staff, including aide Huma Abedin (L), onboard her plane in White Plains, New York, October 22, 2016, on her way to a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. / AFP / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) Law enforcement officials have been hesitant to provide a timeline to the public for when the completion of its review of this treasure trove of emails. There may be evidence hiding in those emails that could incriminate Abedin‚Äôs boss, US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But we likely won‚Äôt find out until after the election, raising unsettling questions about the integrity of our fragile democracy. 
As a matter of principle, the FBI should tell the American people everything it knows before voters cast their ballots on November 8th. Tags "	bias

Barack Obama must be pretty worried. 
Earlier this week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told the media that FBI director James Comey‚Äôs decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt spring from bias or politics. He explained : 
Director Comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the Bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the FBI was considered by the United States Senate... they speak to his good character and the president's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. For example, the president doesn't believe that Director Comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election. And the president doesn't believe he's secretly supporting a candidate or political party. He's in a tough spot. He's the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties. 
Now, with the polls closing to within the margin of error, President Obama has had second thoughts. He told NowThisNews : 
I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don‚Äôt operate on innuendo and we don‚Äôt operate on incomplete information and we don‚Äôt operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable. 
It‚Äôs worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here ‚Äì Obama‚Äôs entire administration has been built on innuendo. His Department of Justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism. His IRS used innuendo to destroy conservative 501(c)3s. His entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about Mitt Romney‚Äôs supposed secret evils. 
But more than anything, the Obama flip here shows serious desperation. What changed? The polls. On Monday, it looked like the FBI scandal would detract from Hillary‚Äôs polling numbers, but wouldn‚Äôt kill her. Now it looks like she might go down in flames. This shows how faithless Obama is ‚Äì Comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened Hillary‚Äôs chances, at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo. 
If Comey has any stones, he should resign in protest at Obama‚Äôs accusations. He‚Äôs already been thrown under the bus by his commander-in-chief for not playing dead for him long enough to move Hillary into the White House. He‚Äôs got no future in his position no matter what he does. It would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell Obama and his cronies to stuff it now. Tags "	bias

4f8fc8c1328ca8987dff82cc7a92e465d0975976	"Clemson University Student's Welcome: 'Ben Shapiro Is A Pig' By: Hank Berrien November 1, 2016 
Apparently word has been passed to leftists that Daily Wire Editor-In Chief Ben Shapiro will be speaking at Clemson University tonight. ""Ben Shapiro Is A Pig"" was chalked in a Clemson classroom this morning. Looks like the SJWs are very excited to hear @benshapiro tonight! pic.twitter.com/hkd3YgIwMn ‚Äî Caleb Ecarma (@calebecarma) November 1, 2016 
There has been no explanation as to who decorated the chalkboard, nor whether the culprit wanted to issue a more eloquent denunciation of Shapiro but was hindered by the limits of his/her vocabulary, thus being restricted to words of three letters or less. 
Shapiro‚Äôs usual denunciation of political correctness is likely the reason for the gratuitous insult; in October 2015, Clemson was plagued by PC when a few students protested Clemson Dining‚Äôs ""Maximum Mexican"" night, tweeting their displeasure with such a ""#CUlturallyInsensitive"" event. Clemson senior Austin Pendergist told Campus Reform the post-event uproar was ‚Äúridiculous ‚Ä¶ This is something that Clemson Dining has done for years without any sort of backlash. People love the cultural nights in the dining halls. What's next? Are they going to take away all potato based food as to not offend students from Irish decent? Remove the stir fry station so Asian-American students don't feel as if they are being misrepresented? When does it end?‚Äù 
But the administration wound up apologizing for the event; Dr. Doug Hallenbeck, Clemson University‚Äôs Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, said the event displayed a ‚Äúflattened cultural view of Mexican culture ‚Ä¶ It is the mission of University Housing & Dining to create supportive and challenging environments that enrich and nourish lives. We failed to live out our mission yesterday, and we sincerely apologize,‚Äù adding that the university ‚Äúwill continue to work closely with [its] food service provider to create dining programs that align with Clemson University‚Äôs core values.‚Äù 
The administration also apologized on the Clemson Dining Services Facebook and Twitter pages. 
Pendergist said the event had only featured ‚Äúa couple balloons, sombreros, and some tacos,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúFor as long as I've been here, and probably for much longer, Clemson dining has put on certain culinary theme nights, where they decorate the dining halls and serve whatever kind of food. They have Italian night, Mexican night, seafood night, midnight breakfast, all kinds of events.‚Äù

9a0225fa7e266d8df58f4cde1b02dd40cd5685e2	"WOW: Indictment ‚ÄòLikely‚Äô in Clinton Foundation Case, Hillary‚Äôs Server Hacked by FIVE Foreign Entities By: November 3, 2016 
Uh-oh. 
According to Bret Baier of Fox News, the FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year, and that investigation has been deep and wide ‚Äì and just as importantly, the FBI is on the verge of indictment for ‚Äúpay-for-play‚Äù with regard to Hillary‚Äôs State Department. The FBI investigation has uncovered laptops from Clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. 
And most importantly of all , the sources at the FBI have apparently told Baier with ‚Äú99 percent accuracy‚Äù that Hillary‚Äôs server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. 
Meanwhile, we now know that the Department of Justice attempted to pressure the FBI into shutting down the investigation into the Clinton Foundation entirely. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI deputy director even asked the DOJ if they truly wanted to shut down a ‚Äúvalidly predicated investigation.‚Äù 
This is devastating information for Hillary. 
Donald Trump is now leading in Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, and North Carolina. Trump is within spitting distance in Colorado and Pennsylvania, and two new polls show Trump up in Virginia and New Hampshire, respectively. If Trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. 
The best case scenario for Hillary Clinton just days ago was simple: hunker down and wait out these scandals. Assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its pre-Comey normal, with Hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. But each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and State Department. Each new day demonstrates the extent of the cover-up by the Obama administration. 
Hillary‚Äôs running out of days to recover. 
The only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now, especially if the American public is upset enough about her pay-for-play and exposure of American classified material to put Trump in the White House, not trusting Loretta Lynch‚Äôs DOJ to prosecute Hillary for her crimes.

916818db05c37698eff155b9aad4fee7533844a9	"7 Things You Need To Know About Trump And Sex Slave Island By: Amanda Prestigiacomo May 9, 2016 
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Hillary Clinton when it comes to her husband's escapades. ""The kitchen sink,"" in this case, is Jeffery Epstein's ‚ÄúSex Slave Island‚Äù and President Bill Clinton‚Äôs ties to it . 
Why wouldn‚Äôt Trump use this ammo? The answer is simple: Trump himself has ties to Epstein, the billionaire Democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having under-age sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls ""Sex Slave Island."" 
Here are seven connections between Trump and Epstein's sex slave endeavors that you need to know about: 
1. Trump himself has said that Epstein is ‚Äúa lot of fun to be with,‚Äù adding that he admired the sex offender's affinity for beautiful women ‚Äúon the younger side.‚Äù 
""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. ""He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."" 
2. Trump was named in Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle black book.‚Äù 
Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äú little black book ‚Äù was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed ""The Holy Grail"" by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed ‚Äú14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and houseman.‚Äù 
3. Trump has allegedly flown on Epstein‚Äôs private plane ‚Äî a hot spot for under-age sex orgies. 
‚ÄúMark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet at least once,‚Äù reports VICE News . ‚ÄúMeanwhile, message pads [see below] from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.‚Äù 
Epstein‚Äôs private Boeing 727, according to one of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, was nicknamed the ‚ÄúLolita Express.‚Äù Roberts recalled ‚Äúunsavoury‚Äù sex orgies on the private plane when she was just 15 years of age with Epstein and his friends. 
4. Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an under-aged girl. 
Radar Online reports that a woman in California, ‚Äúidentified‚Äù as Katie Johnson, filed a $100 million lawsuit against Trump on April 26, accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just 13 years old. 
Johnson ‚Äúclaims Trump raped her when she was 13-years-old and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family,‚Äù notes The Independent UK . ‚ÄúShe claims the alleged abuse took place over a four-month period at underage sex parties held in New York City in 1994.‚Äù Epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats. 
Trump‚Äôs team adamantly denies the accusation, suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù the plaintiff ‚Äúactually exists.‚Äù 
5. Epstein admitted to knowing Trump under oath, and curiously pled the fifth to Trump attending sex parties with underage girls. 
Back in 2010, Epstein admitted to ‚Äúsocializing‚Äù with Trump, but when a lawyer representing an under-aged victim of Epstein‚Äôs asked if he has ‚Äúever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18,‚Äù Epstein curiously pled the Fifth. Per Vice News : Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump? A. What do you mean by ""personal relationship,"" sir? Q. Have you socialized with him? A. Yes, sir. Q. Yes? A. Yes, sir. Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18? A: Though I'd like to answer that question, at least today I'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir. 
6. At least one of Epstein‚Äôs underage sex victims was recruited from Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago ‚Äî which he frequented often. 
Virginia Roberts, an alleged victim of Epstein‚Äôs, ""was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago.‚Äù 
Roberts claims that ‚ÄúEpstein turned her into a ‚Äòsex slave‚Äô and pimped her out to various friends, including England's Prince Andrew. Over the years, the passengers on Epstein's jet, she said, included ‚Äòa whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes some politicians.'"" 
7. Trump was subpoenaed in 2009 for his connection to Epstein‚Äôs under-age sex slave rings. Trump has denied ever being served. 
In 2009, Trump was subpoenaed in a case against Epstein concerning victim Virginia Roberts. Trump's attorney Alan Garten said that the subpoena ""never happened."" 
""There is no debate over what happened,"" said one of Roberts' attorneys. ""I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information‚Ä¶. I can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this."" 
Additionally, Garten told VICE News in January that Mr. Trump has ""no relationship"" with Epstein other than the Democratic donor frequenting Trump's Mar-A-Lago. ""A lot of people hung out there, including Jeffrey Epstein,"" said Garten. ""That is the only connection."" 
According to the evidence, however, the connections with Epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that. Tags"	bias
46d2569c306d2e324c9965ad884c9bb5374f896e	"Christie Lost Republicans The 2012 Election. He May Be Losing Them The 2016 Election, Too. By: Ben Shapiro November 4, 2016 
Ambition can be dangerous. Not just for the ambitious man or woman, but for the country ‚Äì for all those who ally with the ambitious person. 
For the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teacher‚Äôs unions in New Jersey ‚Äì brash language about ‚Äúpunching them in the face‚Äù marked his rise as a political force and an up-and-comer in presidential politics ‚Äì Christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the Republican Party in two straight presidential elections. 
In 2012, Christie was considered and rejected for vice president by Mitt Romney ‚Äì but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the Republican convention. There, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring Romney completely. Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace called the speech ‚Äúthe most curious keynote speech I have ever heard‚Ä¶For a moment I forgot who was the nominee of the party.‚Äù 
Then, the week before the election, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told President Obama that his presence was unnecessary, Christie invited Obama to New Jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of Atlantic City, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. ‚ÄúI cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state,‚Äù Christie said, adding that it was ‚Äúmy honor‚Äù to introduce President Obama. Christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that then-Newark Mayor Corey Booker, who is black, would run against him. As The New York Times noted, ‚ÄúThe scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management ‚Äì only it was run free of charge.‚Äù 
Obama surged in the final days and beat Romney handily. 
Fast forward three years. 
Christie was running in the Republican primaries. He‚Äôd done nothing much in the polls; his only hope was to somehow do well in New Hampshire. He had no support in states like South Carolina or Nevada, or southern states dominated by support for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. So, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the New Hampshire primary ‚Äì a state in which Rubio was surging following his Iowa showing ‚Äì to destroy Rubio. Christie rightly labeled Rubio a robotic candidate, Rubio repeated himself, Christie hit him again ‚Äì and Rubio fell apart in the polling. Trump ran away with the state. Almost immediately, Christie quit the race and fell in behind Trump. Thanks in large part to Christie‚Äôs help, Trump won the nomination. 
Now, with Trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against Hillary Clinton, Christie has struck again: this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to Bridgegate, the scandal in which the Christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local Democrat who wouldn‚Äôt endorse Christie‚Äôs re-election bid . This story will allow the media to shift its focus to the Trump campaign, since Christie is leader of Trump‚Äôs White House transition team. In a tight election, it could be enough to hand Hillary the White House. 
So thanks, Chris Christie. 
The Democrats couldn‚Äôt have done it without you. Tags"	bias

0b7d8c639f8c9549f9d998cad74a161817cb74eb	"11 Stupid Things Vox.com's Matthew Yglesias Has Said By: Aaron Bandler October 26, 2016 
Matt Yglesias of Vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder, given his penchant for saying things that are mind-bogglingly asinine. Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment: Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. 
Fortunately, the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. 
Here are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. 
1. Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare. That is, until he didn't: . @mattyglesias Obamacare marker - which was solid as of 15 minutes ago - appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.com/a0EyXImI8g ‚Äî Omri Ceren (@cerenomri) October 26, 2016 
His 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly ""the media, for non-ideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing."" Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that ""when Obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten."" 
In other words, Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. 
2. Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R). In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, Yglesias wrote, ""Is Bobby Jindal‚Äôs reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping?"" 
Yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting: ""Oh, fun. Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode."" 
Eventually, Yglesias backed down, tweeting: ""For the record, now that I know more about Jindal‚Äôs life it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff."" 
The irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter: Good thing you don't say dumb stuff. MT @mattyglesias It‚Äôs clear that Jindal‚Äôs a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff. ‚Äî jon gabriel (@exjon) June 18, 2013 
3. Yglesias once ranted against ""dumb Jewish politicians."" The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled ""Dumb Jewish Politicians,"" in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait, who wrote in the New Republic that then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. 
""I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers,"" Chait wrote. ""Trust me, it‚Äôs not true. If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. With Lieberman, we all suspect it‚Äôs part of a plan. I think he just has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about and doesn‚Äôt care to learn"" 
Yglesias agreed: 
I‚Äôve long held a related theory about Eric Cantor. 
Anyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend. There‚Äôs a whole bunch‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBoxer, Cardin, Feingold, Feinstein, Franken, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, Specter, and Wyden. It‚Äôs a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted 
4. Yglesias advocated for ending time zones. Seriously. In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space, Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled ""The case against time zones: They're impractical & outdated."" Yglesias pontificated: 
Northern Idaho is connected via I-90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west, but not to Boise to its south so the Couer d'Alene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time. India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a half-hour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. 
Yet while these zig-zags and 30-minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. The need to constantly specify which time zone you're talking about is a drag. Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois' Central Time rather than Indianapolis' Eastern Time. 
But the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. It's to shift the world to one giant time zone. 
Ygleasias then called for ""One time to rule them all""‚Äìa phrase that prompted J.R.R. Tolkien to weep in his grave‚Äìand then wrote this doozy: 
If the whole world used a single GMT-based time, schedules would still vary. In general most people would sleep when it's dark out and work when it's light out. So at 23:00, most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office. But of course London's bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap. The difference from today is that if you were putting together a London-LA conference call at 21:00 there'd be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. A flight that leaves New York at 14:00 and lands in Paris at 20:00 is a six-hour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. If your appointment is in El Paso at 11:30 you don't need to remember that it's in a different time zone than the rest of Texas. 
Pejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesias's time zone piece was, writing at Ricochet : ""I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares? Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them? Don‚Äôt the people at Vox have anything better to write about?"" 
Apparently they don't. 
5. Yglesias doesn't understand Florida's geography very well. Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami. 
""I'd been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know,"" Yglesias said. 
People immediately pointed the obvious answer: Miami couldn't do so because there was this thing called a swamp‚Äìmost of which is The Everglades National Park‚Äìcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish. 
""Yes, yes, commenters I know it's a freaking swamp but there's plenty of development on ex-swampland in Florida -- hence all the canals and weird-looking lakes,"" an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update. 
Except that the land is not ""ex-swampland,"" it's an actual swamp . Maybe Yglesias shouldn't write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. 
6. Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if you're a politician. Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for high-speed rail advocates to provide an ""unrealistically optimistic"" projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. 
""For better or for worse, that‚Äôs politics,"" Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress . 
On Twitter, Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing: ""Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes."" 
And yet, Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter. 
Yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch-22 when he told the Daily Caller to ""go f*** yourself"" when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident. 
7. Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. The Federalist 's Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was ""producing the highest quality care in the country. Their turnaround points the way toward solving America‚Äôs health-care crisis."" Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013, ""Will @Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans?"" This tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the VA has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to ""systemic"" problems with the agency. 
8. Yglesias doesn't understand the purpose of the Senate. Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009, per the Guardian : 
If you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska, one from South Dakota, one from New Hampshire, two from Maine, two from Idaho, two from Nebraska, one from Nevada, two from Utah, two from Kansas, two from Mississippi, one from Iowa, two from Oklahoma, two from Kentucky, one from Louisiana, two from South Carolina, and two from Alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent (on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator) 11.98 percent of the American population. Meanwhile, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the American population. 
Now of course Texas is also a big state (though at 7.81 percent of the population it's a lot smaller than California) and there are small states (like Vermont and North Dakota) that have two Democratic Senators. So the point here isn't a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence. The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 Senators representing the above-average states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people. If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. 
In three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. 
9. Yglesias doesn't understand America's financial system. Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were ""far far far too many banks"" in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous: 
1. They are poorly managed: You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes? This doesn't get better when you drill down to the less-bright and not-as-good guys. It gets worse. And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDIC-ensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. In effect, the well-managed banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. The dubious decision-making doesn't get as complicated as what you see on Wall Street‚Äîit's mostly just classic boom-and-bust pro-cyclical commercial real estate loans‚Äîbut it creates all the same problems. 2. They can't be regulated: Since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carve-outs from regulations. And once the carve-outs exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. They can't compete: If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesn't offer any real competition. Having a large share of America's banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize big-time finance. 
Davis debunked Yglesias's argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there haven't been any new banks formed in recent years (there were at least four in 2013.) 
""Yglesias' arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anti-community bank talking points promoted by the big banks ('You guys, the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America aren‚Äôt the problem. Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. Don‚Äôt worry about the facts. Just go with it.'),"" Davis wrote in The Federalist . ""I'm actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation."" 
10. Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. After reading a review of a Booker T. Washington biography, Yglesias started thinking about ""'black conservative' political tradition,"" prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post, ""It's only extremely recently that the idea of an African-American aligning himself, √† la Clarence Thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible. But even so, that didn‚Äôt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didn‚Äôt exist."" 
This is patently false, as Damon Root explained in Reason : 
Actually, the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuyler‚Äîwho was known as the ‚Äúblack H.L. Mencken‚Äù‚Äîpublished ‚Äúgeneral rightist sentiments‚Äù long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene, including Schuyler‚Äôs unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative. And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDR‚Äôs New Deal... 
11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbart's death, Yglesias tweeted : ""Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart [sic] dead."" 
This tweet has also been deleted, and for good reason‚Äìcelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it's ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he ""is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion."" 
Apparently Slate believes that ""passion"" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities. "	bias

Media analyst and YouTuber Mark Dice took to the streets once again to ask the public what they think of this year's presidential election, specifically, what they think about ol' Crooked Hillary. 
In the video (below), titled ""Why Women Hate Hillary Clinton,"" Dice gives women the opportunity to voice their concerns about the character and integrity of the former Secretary of State, and the results are brutally honest. 


""What's wrong with Hillary? Why do everybody hate her,"" Dice asks the first woman who replies, ""Because she's a criminal."" 
""She's a liar and I hate her voice,"" another woman tells him, adding, ""Her voice drives me crazy."" 
A few more ladies tell Mark that Hillary is a liar, she's terrible, with one woman adding, ""She lost to Obama eight years ago so why is she still running. It's kind of absurd to me."" 
The women also had problems with Hillary's constant scandals, dirty money, bad policies, and her relentlessly playing the gender card. 
""I just believe in more personal freedom and less government control,"" one jogger told the host, while another summed it up with, ""It's time for a change, Hillary's out of here."" 
Exit thought from Dice: 
Hillary Clinton is not a woman. It is a demon. Stop saying ""first female this, and first female that."" Demons have no gender. ‚Äî Mark Dice (@MarkDice) August 31, 2016

1285921de728b4fd19228ddeb1fa78d6db4ca429	"The Media Lost All of Its Political Power Last Night -- Thank You, Donald Trump! By: John Nolte November 9, 2016 
The morally dark Obama-era is over and utterly and totally repudiated. The Clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts. Our smug, supremacist overlords in the Elite Establishment of both Parties, these rotting, rent-seeking parasites, are now vanquished. But nothing is grander, nothing is more glorious, nothing is more satisfying, nothing is sweeter, nothing is more validating, nothing is better for America than the death of the mainstream media's political power. 
The elite national political media is done as a force, moral or otherwise, in this country. Done. Buried. Exposed. Over. Out. And using a slow-acting poison called hubris, it was death by suicide. So smug. So sure of themselves. So sanctimonious. So snark-filled. So utterly incapable of anything close to self-reflection. 
The self-induced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps. 
Here they are. 
1. Pimping for ObamaCare 
The national political media didn‚Äôt just cheerlead for ObamaCare, they LIED to us. Willfully and with malicious intent, they all lied to us. The outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill, right there in black and white. But the media didn't care. They wanted to give their Precious Obama a win and in order to do that, they jumped on board the ""You Can Keep Your Insurance"" propaganda express. Worse, those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists, not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken fact-checkers. 
Then Utopia met reality. 
Then the lies were exposed. 
And the result is that up to and including last night, at both the local and national level, ObamaCare has decimated the Democrat Party. But nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class. 
The media's role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority. From here on, they could only get more sweaty, desperate, and dangerous. 
2. Casting off Every Journalistic Ethic to Destroy Trump 
Openly, proudly, and belligerently, in order to hijack a presidential election, we were treated to the Pompous Announcement that Trump was such a threat to humanity, it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism, starting with objectivity. 
Even former good guys like CNN's Jake Tapper morphed into an unrecognizable LyingSnarkVirtueSignalingMachines -- another rotting cog in the Narrative Wheel, a mindless member of a self-deluded, government-worshiping cult that wouldn‚Äôt piss on Middle America if we were on fire. 
Professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag, baby! And who could miss the historic opportunity to self-righteously point-and-laugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a Brave New World. 
3. Grind Donald Trump To Dust 
While there is no question Trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way, never in my 50 years have I seen such a coordinated, desperate, dishonest, and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity. 
4. Embracing Confirmation Bias 
The longer the general election rolled on, the smaller the bubble of self-delusion became. 
Inconvenient polls were sneered at and Voxsplained away. 
Exit polls could only means ONE thing, even though it was pretty clear they might mean another. 
My personal favorite was the late editorials where, based on no counted votes whatsoever, we were trolled with the news that it was Hillary, not Trump, who would emerge victorious with the ""hidden vote!"" Oh, the delicious irony of that. Oh, how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes' faces on Election Night. 
By the time the votes were actually being counted, I was about 60% sure Hillary would win. The New York Times, however, was 92% sure. ABCNBCCBSAPBSNPRCNNWashingtonPostPolitico were 100% sure. 
But even I understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever, that Hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper Midwest, that the best pollster in the country had Trump up +2, that Trump never lost his fervent base, that the right track/wrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade, that there was still a larger-than-usual number of undecideds, that this thing that was Real might not be enough to win, but it was still Real. 
No, no, we were told, it's all smoke and mirrors, all gold-leafed Trump Steaks. Look at Obama's approval ratings! Look at the Hispanic vote! Look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there. Sit down, son, don‚Äôt you understand that I'm a data machine? It's science, rube. Don't you Vox, racist? 
And then the worst thing imaginable happened‚Ä¶. 
5. The Media Lost the Election 
The hate, the lies, the removal of the mask of objectivity, the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table -- that can actually work ‚Ä¶ IF YOU WIN. 
But the media didn‚Äôt win. 
In the most spectacular fashion, with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see, they lost. 
And with that loss went EVERYTHING. 
And now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a Swaggering Potemkin Bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion, even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man, and do so with much of the Republican Party on their side. 
Not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch, worse than all that, they are exposed as WEAK, a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again. 
Without that sheen of fear, without that threat of intimidation, like a vanquished bully, so goes all their power. 
F*** you, mainstream media. 
-- 
The delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious Barack Obama correct about one thing‚Ä¶ 
The moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice.

A YouTube video that's making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for Trump. 
In the clip (below), what appears to be a middle-aged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. The camera person yells, ""Happens when you vote Trump, dummy,"" while a woman next to him shouts, ""You voted Trump? You voted Trump? Damn! Yeah, he voted Trump! Damn!"" 


The man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. 
""Get out of my car,"" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, ""You're gonna pay for my shit!"" One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. 
The camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, ""Beat his ass! Don't vote Trump! Don't vote Trump!"" 
The video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. 
In the longer version of the video (below) posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. 
The criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets.

c65333af24a25c602acdeafb07ee6e35654f3e12	"Poll: Sexism Was NOT A Factor In Hillary's Loss By: Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 
Some leftists still reeling from Hillary Clinton's stunning defeat on Tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president. However, a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in Clinton's loss. 
The poll, conducted by Conquest Communications Group and published on Just Facts , featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism: ""If you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate, who would you vote for?"" 
Here were the results (emphasis added): 
Overall, 69% of voters said ‚ÄúIt does not matter,‚Äù 15% preferred a female, 12% preferred a male, 3% were unsure, and 1% refused to answer. 
Male voters and Trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say ‚ÄúIt does not matter,‚Äù at 73% and 72% respectively. The other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error, with rates of: 67% for Clinton voters. 66% for undecided voters. 64% for females. 
Naturally, supporters of Trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president‚Äì25 percent to 2 percent, respectively‚Äìand Clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president, 27 percent to 5 percent, respectively. 
The survey was conducted from October 11-23, so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election. But it's hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists. 
There is a little bias towards a male president among Trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among Clinton voters, but the results of the survey suggest that overall, the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States. 
Democrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesn't work. Speaking of identity politics, it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well . Tags "	bias

President-elect Donald Trump. That is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people, as he was not expected to win on Tuesday. What were the driving factors that propelled Trump to the presidency? How was he able to pull off such a stunning upset? 
Here are seven reasons why Trump won. 
1. Hillary Clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her. Last night, Dems were calling the race a ""Whitelash"" -- wrong. Mitt won 59% of white vote, Trump won 58%. Minority voters didn't turn out. ‚Äî David French (@DavidAFrench) November 9, 2016 
In fact, Trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012, as the Daily Wire has explained : 
Unsurprisingly, Trump lost to Clinton in the Latino and black votes by margins of 88 percent to 8 percent and 65 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Surprisingly, this was better than Romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in 2012, as he lost both groups by margins of 93 percent to 7 percent and 71 percent to 27 percent, respectively 
Michael Barone has noted that ""turnout fell in heavily black Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. Millennial generation turnout was tepid, and Trump carried white Millennials by 5 points."" 
The enthusiasm was just not there for Clinton. 
2. Trump was able to pull in former Obama voters. According to the Washington Post , Trump was able to win over one-third of the 700 counties that went for Obama twice. Clinton was only able to win six of the 2,200 counties that didn't go for Obama. Trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than Clinton was. 
So who are these former Obama voters who voted for Trump in 2016, and what caused them to switch? 
3. These former Obama voters felt that Trump cared about them, and the Democrat Party did not. John Daniel Davidson explains in The Federalist that Clinton and the Democrat Party took the blue-collar, working class whites in the Rust Belt for granted‚Äìexemplified by Clinton's pledge ""to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business""‚Äìand it was to their detriment. The Rust Belt has been in economic decline for years, but it has suffered greatly from the Obama administration's regulations towards coal. 
While the Democrats wrote off the Rust Belt, Trump actually acknowledged their struggles, and that was all it took. 
""Trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them, acknowledged that they have been left behind, that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline, and promised to help out somehow,"" writes Davidson. ""When you‚Äôre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion, as President Obama did in 2008, or denounced as 'deplorables' and 'irredeemable,' as Hillary Clinton did during this election, respect goes a long way‚Äîeven if there are no easy solutions, from Washington or anywhere else, to the problems that plague your town."" 
4. The FBI re-opening its investigation into Hillary's emails helped Trump. Per RedState , author Ed Klein said on the Steve Malzberg Show that Clinton was sobbing ""inconsolably"" on election night and was blaming FBI director James Comey re-opening the investigation as well as Obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost. 
There's no question that the re-opening of the investigation did considerably help Trump, as the polls severely tightened after the announcement. Poll numbers showed that the vast majority of Americans felt that Hillary was acting in an immoral manner. The spotlight was off of Trump's vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers, and instead the focus was on Clinton's private email server. But Clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss... 
5. Hillary was a terrible candidate. If Clinton had been elected president, she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous FBI investigations. She broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official State Department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the Clinton Foundation . Clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure, sleaze, and corruption. Basically, Clinton is ""an Obama Democrat without Obama's charm,"" according to Jonah Goldberg . 
She may have been the only Democratic candidate that could lose to Trump, and the Democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning. They have no one to blame but themselves for President Trump. 
6. The public no longer has any faith in the media‚Äìand that includes late-night comics. Will Rahn wrote at CBS News that the ""unbearable smugness"" of the Clinton-biased media was off-putting to a lot of voters, as they sneered at Trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up Clinton. Trump's vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically. Poll numbers reflect this, as trust in the media has declined over the years. Rahn explains: 
Journalists increasingly don‚Äôt even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement, and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way. We see this in the ongoing veneration of ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously post-ideological. 
That the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soul-searching you‚Äôd think it would. Instead, it all just somehow leads us to more smugness, more meanness, more certainty from the reporters and pundits. Faced with defeat, we retreat further into our bubble, assumptions left unchecked. No, it‚Äôs the voters who are wrong. 
As a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. Out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. We can‚Äôt even imagine the right question. We go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. The public‚Äôs estimation of the press declines even further -- fewer than one-in-three Americans trust the press, per Gallup -- which starts the cycle anew. 
The same applies to late-night comics. Mollie Hemingway writes in The Federalist that Jon Stewart is partly responsible for the election of Trump because of how he single-handedly destroyed CNN's Crossfire, resulting in ""a new age of hyper-political, hyper-liberal late-night comedy."" Stewart's The Daily Show spawned Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Trevor Noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy left-wing political lectures talking down to conservatives. 
""Jon Stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day,"" writes Hemingway. ""He got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree. The results include a further erosion of civility, a decrease in Americans‚Äô ability to understand each other and their concerns, and, of all things, President-elect Donald Trump."" 
Which all culminates into the main reason why Trump was elected... 
7. Americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites. Ben Shapiro explains : 
Trump won because many Americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as Barack Obama and his Department of Justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country. 
Trump won because many Americans were sick of watching other Americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance ‚Äì for their religious beliefs, for their unwillingness to label women men and men women, for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates. 
Trump won because many Americans were tired of the media‚Äôs constant harping on America‚Äôs flaws ‚Äì we were supposedly sexist, racist, and homophobic. Americans said that they did not believe the media, and they were right to do so. 
In other words, the left has been tearing down America as a country infested with intolerant, prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives. The people finally had had enough, so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites. Tags "	bias

This is the best picture in human history. 
It is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties, the republic, and why we are where we are. 
On the left side of this picture, we have Donald Trump ‚Äì a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian, the new president-elect of the United States. He points his fingers and smiles that Apprentice smile as he makes a point. 
On the right side of this picture, we have Barack Obama ‚Äì a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. He sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office. And Obama, rightly, looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes. 
Behind Obama sits a bust of Abraham Lincoln, his eyes downcast, mourning for his country. 
Yep. 
Greatest picture ever. 
This is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant. Barack Obama‚Äôs image of himself is not accurate ‚Äì to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star. He transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfie-stick, celebrity-ridden sinkhole of Hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with Glozell and Macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with Jimmy Kimmel before saying that a reality star like Trump could never be president. 
This picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as Obama‚Äôs former pastor might put it. 
And then there‚Äôs Lincoln. 
Lincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind Barack Obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. 
Lincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd. Given Republicans‚Äô domination of the Senate and the Congress, I have hopes for Trump‚Äôs presidency ‚Äì I hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president, and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises ‚Äì but Trump occupying Lincoln‚Äôs office is, at best, a jarring visual.

During an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes , which will air in its entirety Sunday night, Donald Trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants: 
""We are getting them out of our country,"" the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. ""After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people who we're going to make a determination on, but before we make a determination, we want to secure our border."" 
Gasp. 
Donald Trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration. Throughout the primary process, he promised a "" deportation force ,"" telling MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski in November 2015: 
""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely. Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. It's going to be a real deal. It's going to be a real wall."" 
In August, Trump delivered a major immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he softened his stance a bit, focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes: 
""Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice."" 
He then added that ""anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don‚Äôt have a country."" 
During the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump reiterated his position against amnesty: 
""Well, first of all, [Clinton] wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders."" 
For Trump diehards, these statements were enough. Their guy was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and no one would tell them otherwise. However, as anyone with access to Google should know, the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion. 
In July 2015, Donald Trump told CNN's Dana Bash: 
""I would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legal‚Ä¶A lot of these people are helping us‚Ä¶and sometimes it‚Äôs jobs a citizen of the United States doesn‚Äôt want to do. I want to move ‚Äôem out, and we‚Äôre going to move ‚Äôem back in and let them be legal."" 
What Trump was talking about is known as ""touchback amnesty."" Such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants, but allow them an expedited means of returning to the United States in order to obtain legal status. In other words, they touch base in their home country, then come right back. 
In November 2015, Eric Trump repeated his father's plan during an interview with Fox News' Megyn Kelly: 
""The point isn‚Äôt just deporting them, it‚Äôs deporting them and letting them back in legally. He‚Äôs been so clear about that and I know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it, but its deporting them and letting them back legally."" 
Going back further, Trump's support for amnesty is even more stark. Speaking on Fox & Friends in 2012, he said: 
""For people that have been here for years that have been hard-workers, have good jobs, they‚Äôre supporting their family‚Äìit‚Äôs very, very tough to just say ‚ÄòBy the way, 22 years, you have to leave. Get out‚Äô‚Ä¶I‚Äôm one of the world‚Äôs very conservative people, but I have to tell you on a human basis, how do you throw somebody out that‚Äôs lived in this country for twenty years?"" 
During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Trump even called Mitt Romney's idea of self-deportation "" maniacal ,"" and remarked that Republican Party policy toward illegal immigrants was "" mean-spirited ."" 
Donald Trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win. Now that he has won, he's already backtracking on multiple campaign promises, from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to the deportation of illegal immigrants. Tags "	bias
df9cb42d62d6bcaff8f21a17365c48df313a6724	"3 Thoughts On Steve Bannon As White House 'Chief Strategist' By: Ben Shapiro November 14, 2016 
So, in a not-unexpected move, Donald Trump has elevated former Breitbart News CEO Steve Bannon to chief strategist of the White House. 
When I left Breitbart back in March, I accused Bannon of turning Breitbart News into Trump Pravda ; as I wrote, ‚ÄúIndeed, Breitbart News, under the chairmanship of Steve Bannon, has put a stake through the heart of Andrew‚Äôs legacy. In my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew‚Äôs mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump; he has shaped the company into Trump‚Äôs personal Pravda, to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter.‚Äù 
That decision paid off for Bannon ‚Äì in August, he became Trump‚Äôs campaign ‚ÄúCEO.‚Äù At that point, I wrote this piece describing who Bannon was , and this one for The Washington Post describing his probable impact on the campaign . 
With Bannon‚Äôs accession to a top White House role, it‚Äôs time to answer some brief questions about the man and what he‚Äôs likely to do. 
Is Bannon Anti-Semitic And Racist? I have no evidence that Bannon‚Äôs a racist or that he‚Äôs an anti-Semite; the Huffington Post‚Äôs blaring headline ‚ÄúWHITE NATIONALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE‚Äù is overstated, at the very least. With that said, as I wrote at The Washington Post in August, Bannon has openly embraced the racist and anti-Semitic alt-right ‚Äì he called his Breitbart ‚Äú the platform of the alt-right .‚Äù Milo Yiannopoulos, the star writer at the site, is an alt-right popularizer , even as he continuously declares with a wink that he‚Äôs not a member. The left‚Äôs opposition to Trump, and their attempts to declare all Trump support the alt-right have obfuscated what the movement is. The movement isn‚Äôt all Trump supporters. It‚Äôs not conservatives unsatisfied with Paul Ryan, nor is it people angry at the media. Bannon knows that. He‚Äôs a smart man, not an ignorant one. The alt-right, in a nutshell, believes that Western culture is inseparable from European ethnicity . I have no evidence Bannon believes that personally. But he‚Äôs happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European far-right nationalist populism. That means that the alt-right will cheer Bannon along as he marbles Trump‚Äôs speeches with talk of ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù ‚Äì and that Bannon won‚Äôt be pushing Trump to dump the racists and anti-Semites who support Trump anytime soon. After all, they love Bannon ‚Äì actual white supremacists like Peter Brimelow called his August appointment ‚Äúgreat news,‚Äù and Richard Spencer explained, ‚ÄúBreitbart has elective affinities with the Alt Right, and the Alt Right has clearly influenced Breitbart. In this way, Breitbart has acted as a ‚Äògateway‚Äô to Alt Right ideas and writers. I don‚Äôt think it has done this deliberately; again, it‚Äôs a matter of elective affinities.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt mean Bannon will push racist or anti-Semitic policy, or that he‚Äôll be anti-Israel himself ‚Äì unless it serves his interests. 
What Does Bannon‚Äôs Accession Mean? Bannon has goals. One of those goals is maximization of personal power, which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful right-wing personalities (Bachmann, Morris, Palin), kissing their asses, and then moving on up the chain. With Breitbart and Trump, he picked two winners in a row ‚Äì and that means he‚Äôs now at the pinnacle of American power. 
So, what will he do with that power? He‚Äôll target enemies. Bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics, which is why I‚Äôve been joking for months that should Trump win, I‚Äôd be expecting my IRS audit any moment. That wasn‚Äôt completely a joke. He likes to destroy people. 
But more importantly, Bannon‚Äôs interested in turning the Republican Party into a far-right European party. Because Republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that, it could happen. Here‚Äôs what I wrote in March about the Trump movement : 
Trump is a European-style response to the European-style leftism of Barack Obama. He‚Äôs a soft European-style populist, from his interventionist economics to his closed-borders foreign policy. As I wrote in December, ‚ÄúCompare Trump‚Äôs platform with that of Marine Le Pen, whose French National Front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment. She calls for harsher penalties for criminals, significant restrictions on Muslim immigration to France, protectionism on trade, a restoration of the Franc as the national currency rather than the Euro, and big government in terms of health care. This sounds a lot like Trump.‚Äù But the European right is not the American right. The American right believes in Constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government. The European right doesn‚Äôt believe any of these things. Should Trump win, we could watch American conservatism lose the only party it has ever had. 
That‚Äôs the plan. Yesterday, The Daily Beast reported that Bannon reached out to Le Pen for ‚Äúglobal ultra-right coalition.‚Äù Over the weekend Le Pen met with Nigel Farage of the UK Independent Party. And Trump met with Farage shortly after being elected. Bannon has always wanted to burn down the GOP. That‚Äôs still his goal. He wants it replaced with an American National Front party in fact if not in name. 
Which War Will Bannon Lead? Bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore ‚Äì always at war. Always. So the only question left is this: what will Bannon‚Äôs actual role be? It‚Äôs difficult to tell, since Trump announced the Bannon hire at the same time he announced that former RNC chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff. What will their relationship be like? Ed Morrissey of HotAir thinks that Bannon will lead the anti-media fight, and Reince will coordinate with Congress. That would be the best possible scenario. 
Others have speculated that Bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base, which would be angry at Trump hopping into bed with the most establishment-y fellow in Washington. That, too, would be fine. 
It‚Äôs hard to tell from the outside what‚Äôs happening, but here‚Äôs a third theory: Reince is the bagman for Trump, and Bannon‚Äôs whispering in Trump‚Äôs ear. That would fit the fact pattern here, given Reince‚Äôs outsized praise for Bannon this morning: ‚Äúwise and smart‚Ä¶very, very smart, very temperate.‚Äù Bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree. He‚Äôs a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees; he's actually malevolent. Priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because he‚Äôs the one catering to Bannon‚Äôs agenda. 
If Bannon‚Äôs leading and Reince is following, that bodes ill for the Republican agenda. Bannon opposes the Republican Party, hates Paul Ryan ‚Äì minutes after the joint Bannon/Priebus announcement, Breitbart News approvingly tweeted about a Congressional rebellion against Speaker Ryan ‚Äì and wants to watch it all ‚Äúburn.‚Äù Bannon loves the firefight. The only question is which direction he‚Äôll turn his fire. Tags"	bias

8554a69aa72a1b278ca7dd5cb53b5db32b03b11e	"Shapiro Eviscerates Raucous Protesters At University Of Wisconsin By: Hank Berrien November 16, 2016 
Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. 
After the ovation he received on entering, Shapiro quipped, ‚ÄúHey look at this. A campus that doesn‚Äôt actually try to arrest me when I come.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúBefore I begin, I did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. I hear you‚Äôve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how you‚Äôre not one of these awful, terrible Trump people, that you‚Äôre sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so I‚Äôve brought along these safety pins, (holding up safety pins) and I also brought you something to wear them with ‚Äì this diaper."" 
Shapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. 
When a protester yelled at Shapiro that he should be ‚Äúwearing a swastika,‚Äù Shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, ‚ÄúIn case you hadn‚Äôt noticed, the folks with the swastikas aren‚Äôt too nice to my type.‚Äù 
Shapiro continued, ‚ÄúStop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for Trump is a vicious racist; it‚Äôs your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election ‚Ä¶ Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt care about your protest. Donald Trump is sitting somewhere in Trump Tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears.‚Äù 
Referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who weren‚Äôt university students from attending Shapiro‚Äôs lecture, Shapiro opined: ‚ÄúI hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. I do have a quick question: if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban American citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? And by the way, I‚Äôm aware of this private Facebook page titled ‚ÄòF(***) White Supremacy: Interrupting Ben Shapiro.' With all due respect, ‚ÄòF‚Äô you right back, gang.‚Äù 
After the applause subsided and Shapiro joked about how both Black Lives Mater and the KKK target him, the real fun began. Protesters stood up, chanting, ‚ÄúShame‚Äù over and over again. 
Shapiro quipped, ‚ÄúWow, it‚Äôs like Game of Thrones . Should I get undressed and walk down the aisle?‚Äù 
The bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. Shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to talk with you,‚Äù but they responded by screaming ‚Äúsafety‚Äù over and over. Shapiro joked, ‚ÄúDid somebody fart?‚Äù The crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, ‚ÄúUSA.‚Äù 
Shapiro replied, ‚ÄúI tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúYou see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout ‚ÄòSafety,‚Äù and you‚Äôre perfectly safe. Look at that. It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù That provoked sustained applause. 
When the protesters started screaming ‚ÄúShame‚Äù again, Shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to pick a chant like ‚ÄòShame,‚Äô watch Game of Thrones first. The bad guys shout ‚ÄòShame.‚Äô‚Äù The audience loved that line. On a roll, Shapiro continued, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not changing anybody‚Äôs mind, All you‚Äôre showing everybody is that your collective IQ, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly.‚Äù 
He continued, ‚ÄúOkay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? Now‚Äôs your chance to get it out. Let‚Äôs hear your feelings. C‚Äômon. Just go for it. Or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer?‚Äù 
When the protesters resumed chanting, Shapiro responded, ‚ÄúIf you guys want to talk, we can talk, If you want to shout, get the hell out.‚Äù More applause. 
Shapiro fired, ‚ÄúFor God's sake, at least wait until I say something that offends you before getting offended."" 
Shapiro returned to deconstructing the term ‚Äúsocial justice.‚Äù When the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should ‚Äúshut freaking up and listen to the man speak.‚Äù That prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and Shapiro. too. He added, ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably.‚Äù 
Shapiro returned to his speech: ‚ÄúRacial diversity doesn‚Äôt mean anything; decency means everything ‚Ä¶ Diversity isn‚Äôt our strength; decency is our strength.‚Äù He turned to the protesters: Remember that? Decency.‚Äù 
The protesters screamed back, ‚ÄúShame!‚Äù Shapiro fired back, ‚ÄúDecency!‚Äù The protesters chanted ‚ÄúShame‚Äù but the crowd soon joined Shapiro in chanting ‚ÄúDecency,‚Äù shutting the protesters up. 
As Shapiro spoke of the falsity of ‚Äúwhite privilege,‚Äù the protesters formed a line in front of Shapiro, prompting him to quip, ‚ÄúIf you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something?‚Äù 
The protesters chanted ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, ‚ÄúFree speech matters.‚Äù Shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, ‚ÄúMORONS‚Äù That again prompted cheering. 
One member of the audience yelled to the protesters, ‚ÄúAt least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out!‚Äù That brought a sustained ovation. 
After one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù again, then filed out, yelling ‚ÄúF*** white supremacy‚Äù while flipping off Shapiro and the entire audience. That prompted the crowd to sing, ‚ÄúNa-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye.‚Äù It also promoted this from Shapiro: 
Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. 
After Shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, ‚ÄúAll I can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event.‚Äù 
Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting Shapiro to quip, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt this school give homework? Does anybody have a job around here? I guess when you‚Äôre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands.‚Äù 
Shapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. When he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. He fired back, ‚ÄúReally? Was it the yarmulke that did it for you?‚Äù 
He took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, ‚ÄúSome people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters.‚Äù 
The rest of the speech was vintage Shapiro, as was the Q&A afterward. Even the chalk was impressive: 
Went back to the lecture hall and grabbed the EXACT piece of chalk @benshapiro used to write MORONS! #FactsNotFeelings #onlyatYAF pic.twitter.com/W0Ch06SaGR ‚Äî Japheth Patterson (@japhood) November 17, 2016

8e3575e9590f22e26b497e515d5d204e880fd94b	"5 Things You Need to Know About 'Sanctuary Cities' By: Aaron Bandler November 16, 2016 
With Donald Trump elected to the presidency, one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities, cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens. The issue became front-and-center during the early portion of the Republican primary when Trump decried the murder of Kate Steinle by an illegal alien in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. 
In response to the election of Trump, leftist city leaders are digging in, officials in Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal government's deportation efforts. Here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities. 
1. Sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law. Some on the left have tried to claim that they're perfectly legal, but this is clearly false. As James Walsh , former associate general counsel of Immigration and Naturalization Services, explains, 8 USC section 1324 ""deals with those persons who knowingly conceal, harbor, or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states."" 
The fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means they're supporting a form of nullification, an irony not missed by Victor Davis Hanson : 
Much of the rural West opposes the Endangered Species Act. Can Wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders, when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways? Many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales. Could Oklahoma City declare hand-gun purchases within its city-limits free of federal firearms statutes? Perhaps Little Rock could ignore a Supreme Court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction. On what rationale would liberals in California object to such nullifications -- that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials? 
Trump and the GOP can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law. 
2. Sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement. Not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals, sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job. Some police officers in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) expressed their frustration with the city's sanctuary city policy to Heather Mac Donald in 2004: 
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt even talk about it,‚Äù says a frustrated LAPD captain. ‚ÄúPeople are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics.‚Äù Another LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic, gang-infested district sighs: ‚ÄúI would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about [enforcing the immigration law against illegals].‚Äù 
In that 2004 piece, Mac Donald documents how members of the LAPD were able to recognize known gang members, but couldn't do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime ‚Äì despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country. This is the case with other sanctuary cities as well. 
3. Sanctuary cities are ""akin to roulette."" ""The odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ICE for deportation,"" writes Hanson. ""On the chance that some of their 10,000 released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of Juan Lopez-Sanchez, officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down, or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens."" 
But the odds don't suggest this. Hanson notes that according to Mac Donald, ""Two-thirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of Los Angeles involved illegal aliens -- as well as 95% of outstanding murder warrants."" 
Additionally, Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies found that in a nine-month timeframe in 2014, sanctuary cities shielded 9,265 illegals from deportation, 62 percent of which ""had significant prior criminal histories"" and 2,320 of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes, according to Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review. 
""There is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught,"" writes Horowitz. ""This is just a nine-month snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies. As of last year, 69% of them were still at large. So much for not being a flight risk."" 
According to Vaughn , from January 2014 to September 30, 2015, sanctuary cities rebuked over 17,000 detainers, 68 percent of which involved ""individuals with a prior criminal history."" 
Based on these statistics, it would seem that the odds are against the cities' residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens, which makes it no surprise that... 
4. Crime has surged in sanctuary cities. The Daily Wire 's Hank Berrien reported on the following from Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry: 
According to Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, crime has risen in ""sanctuary cities"" across the nation. 
Landry told the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, that sanctuary city policies ""allow illegals to commit crimes, then roam free in our communities."" Landry‚Äôs appearance was prompted by the changed status of New Orleans, where city police are now banned from asking an individual's immigration status. 
Using recent statistics from Los Angeles, another sanctuary city, Landry asserted, ‚ÄúLos Angeles saw all crime rise in 2015: violent crime up 19.9 percent, homicides up 10.2 percent, shooting victims up 12.6 percent, rapes up 8.6 percent, robberies up 12.3 percent, and aggravated assault up 27.5 percent ‚Ä¶ (sanctuary cities) encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base."" 
This would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime . 
5. There are an estimated 300 sanctuary cities, counties, and states, according to Vaughn. The full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here . Do you live in a sanctuary city? "	bias

As a woman who rejects third-wave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis, I've had my fair share of feminists tell me that I only reject them and their ideas because I suffer from ""internalized misogyny,"" or, in other words, I'm a self-loathing sexist. 
Here's exactly how Everyday Feminism defines ""internalized misogyny,"" if you're unfamiliar with bats*** crazy: 
Internalized misogyny, by definition, is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women. 
It becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate, overtly and covertly, that women are less than men ‚Äì less worthy, less strong, less dependable, less able, less of a leader, less logical ‚Äì while also more than men: more emotional, more irrational, more complex, more to manage. 
Of course, this is ridiculous, and I gave such an assertion about as much time as a I would a male feminist hitting on me: zero seconds. 
But on Wednesday, I learned that Team Hillary, the political left, likewise thought me a self-loathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for Queen Pantsuit because I couldn't stomach the thought of a powerful woman, since I apparently believe women are lessers. In fact, I‚Äîa woman with a chronic case of ""internalized misogyny‚Äù‚Äîcost Hillary the election; not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity, nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag. It was my fault.

Yeah, no. I didn't pull the lever for Trump because I hate myself. I don't. Not even a little actually. I just hate you. 
Let me define ""you."" 
""You"" are the feminists who contend my uterus must dictate all my choices; those who make it their mission to drag down any woman who has the audacity to veer from your ideology one iota. 
""You"" are the feminists who tell me that there's a special place in hell for me if I don't cast my ballot for Crooked Hillary. (Like all of a sudden feminists believe in God and an afterlife. LOL.) 
""You"" are the feminists who tell me I'm super mean and *shame* women when I point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable. By the way, it is gross and despicable . 
""You"" are the feminists who demonize men with think-pieces on how and why we should banish so-called "" toxic masculinity "" from this world. 
""You"" are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct. And no, I will not cater to your preferred pronouns, you entitled brat. (Pro-tip: Once the number of genders you've made-up passes the number of flavors at Baskin Robbins, it's time to admit you have a problem.) 
""You"" are the social justice warriors who tell me I'm a hateful, selfish, capitalistic pig from your iPhone at your local safe space, equipped with coloring books, bubbles and puppies, across from the Starbucks you work weekends at. 
""You"" are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you don't get your way, meanwhile you're not even registered to vote . 
""You"" are the social justice warriors shouting-down any free speech which doesn't perfectly align with your ideology, ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness. 
""You"" are the virtue-signaling celebrities who think I give a hoot about your political stance. Please, go ahead and move to Canada, no one will miss you. I certainly won't. 
""You"" are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that you'll lie to the American people to advance it; so hell-bent on painting middle-America and Republicans as racist you'll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of ""Who's The Biggest Xenophobe: Republican Edition."" 
""You"" are the leftist telling me I'm a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group Black Lives Matter. First of all, it's mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids. Second of all, call me crazy, but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers , I'm out. I know, how *racist* of me. 
""You"" are leftists calling me an Islamophobe because I use the term ""radical Islam"" and resist an influx of refugees whom the FBI said we cannot properly vet pouring into our country. 
You see, this election had virtually nothing to do with Donald Trump‚ÄîI could take him or leave him‚Äîand almost everything to do with you, the left. Trump was indeed a protest vote; he was a direct repudiation of everything you stand for and everything you tell me I should stand for by virtue of my uterus. 
So, no, I'm not a self-loathing victim of ""the patriarchy"" who passed on a vote for Hillary because she's a woman. I just hate you.

The media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming Trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. Instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that Trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka ‚Äì he invited them to a state meeting with Japan ‚Äì they‚Äôre trying to claim that he just isn‚Äôt moving fast enough on appointments. 
That‚Äôs nuts. 
Barack Obama didn‚Äôt name his picks for Secretary of State, Defense, or Attorney General until December 1, nearly a month after the November 4, 2008 election. George W. Bush didn‚Äôt name his picks for State, Defense, or Attorney General until mid-December (December 16 for Colin Powell, December 28 for Donald Rumsfeld, December 22 for John Ashcroft). Bill Clinton didn‚Äôt name his picks for those positions until at least December 22. George H.W. Bush was the fastest off the mark ‚Äì he named James Baker Secretary of State the day after the November 8 election. Ronald Reagan waited until December 11 to get started; Jimmy Carter waited until December 3. 
We‚Äôre still waiting on Trump‚Äôs State and Defense picks, but he‚Äôs already out of the gate with Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. It‚Äôs November 17. 
The media are so eager to bury Trump‚Äôs administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. Instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks ‚Äì Steve Bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because he‚Äôs a racist or anti-Semite ‚Äì the media keep proclaiming THE END IS NEAR. This sort of alarmism doesn‚Äôt convince Americans, who don‚Äôt really see why there‚Äôs any giant rush to appoint people who aren‚Äôt going to be formally considered by the Senate until January 20 anyway. 
If this election was about repudiation of the media ‚Äì and it was ‚Äì the media aren‚Äôt doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù For years, Americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. Each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. Tags "	bias

President-elect Donald Trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who has long been a favorite of conservatives. The Democrats already have the long knives out for Sessions, spit-balling their usual accusations of racism‚Äìwhich should indicate that Sessions will be an effective attorney general. 
Here are seven things you need to know about Sessions. 
1. Sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on Conservative Review . Sessions has been in the Senate for 20 years, and has been described by the Washington Times as ""a tea partier before the tea party was cool,"" per Conservative Review 's biography . 
2. Sessions has been one of the leaders in the Senate in fighting against amnesty. For instance, Sessions was among the most prominent members of the Senate leading the opposition to the Gang of Eight Bill. National Review , which dubbed Sessions ""amnesty's worst enemy,"" explained how Sessions would reveal ""true facts"" about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadn't decided how to vote on the legislation. Sessions and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as ""an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez"" in which Vitter noted Chavez's opposition to illegal immigration, putting Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in ""an awkward position."" 
In 2015, Sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to Conservative Review : Overturned the Zadvydas v. Davis Supreme Court case that Obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention Explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law Eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off DHS and DOJ law enforcement grants Expedited deportation of gang members Applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving Clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported (this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the Washington, D.C. ‚Äúmansion murders‚Äù) 
Sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as ""the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States."" 
""What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,"" Sessions wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the Washington Post . 
3. Sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. According to Conservative Review 's biography of Sessions: 
In January 2011, he was named Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. In this capacity, he led the Republican charge against Majority Leader Harry Reid and Barack Obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the Senate had not passed a budget since April 2009. He has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against Democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. He has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the Ryan-Murray budget deal. Sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. 
Sessions has voted against the TARP bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state ""with charts warning of the United States' 'crippling' debt,"" per the Washington Post . 
4. Sessions endorsed Trump early on. To the surprise of many in the establishment, Sessions endorsed Trump in February, declaring , ""I believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. This is a campaign, this is a movement. The American people are not happy with their government."" 
It shouldn't have come as a surprise though, given Session's record on immigration and that Sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. 
5. Sessions is well-liked by his Senate colleagues on a personal level. According to the Washington Post : 
""Say what you will about him,"" former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. ""He was always nice to [the late Ted] Kennedy and other Democrats as well."" 
Even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. Stanley-Becker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded: ""Please don‚Äôt say that. That‚Äôs my nightmare. I promise I‚Äôll be nice."" 
It's no wonder then that Sessions will likely be confirmed by the Senate. 
6. Accusations of racism against Sessions are absurd. When President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions, who at the time was a U.S. attorney, to a federal judge, the Democrats smeared Sessions with accusations of racism, which included: Calling a black attorney ""boy."" Quipping about the Ku Klux Klan: ""I used to think they were OK, but they are pot smokers."" Joking that a white attorney was ""a traitor to his race"" because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. Calling the NAACP and ACLU ""un-American."" Prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. 
The last point isn't racist at all. The jokes, as Ben Shapiro has written , were made ""in front of the black lawyer; even the lawyer accusing Sessions of racism acknowledged that Sessions was joking."" Clearly Sessions meant them as harmless jokes. Sessions has also denied calling the lawyer ""boy."" The civil rights group Sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. 
Sessions' record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as The Weekly Standard 's Mark Hemingway writes: 
As a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted the head of the state Klan, Henry Francis Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and made sure the Hays executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also led to a $7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama. 
7. As attorney general, Sessions would uphold the rule of law. The reason why Sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. He has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. Between that and his legal background as a U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that Sessions will follow the law and not politicize the Justice Department. 
""His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor,"" Robert Driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in National Review . ""Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. Creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division (intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law) will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. That alone will be a breath of fresh air."" Tags "	bias

The Democratic congressman who is challenging House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, threatened a ‚ÄúYoungstown street fight‚Äù if Donald Trump attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. 
Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNN‚Äôs State of the Union on Sunday, Ryan intimated that defunding Planned Parenthood wasn‚Äôt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. He stated, ‚ÄúIf he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol.‚Äù 
Youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past; last May and August violence erupted on the streets of the city. 
Ryan called Trump‚Äôs infrastructure plan ‚Äúa bunch of smoke and mirrors.‚Äù He added that he didn‚Äôt blame Pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt in good conscience hang this election around Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs neck, of course. But, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for Donald Trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for Donald Trump.‚Äù 
Ryan‚Äôs campaign to replace Pelsoi is picking up steam; on Sunday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice endorsed him, stating, ""He has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isn‚Äôt suggesting he has all the answers ‚Äî he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy,"" Rice said in a statement.

198c34f79e7e70b936057a7c21af2f021e2a02f1	"SNOWFLAKE: Colbert Didn‚Äôt Want To Write Jokes About Trump Winning By: Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 
Conversing with fellow Daily Show ‚Äúcomic‚Äù John Oliver at the Montclair Film Festival on Saturday night, Late Show unfunny host Stephen Colbert admitted that he couldn‚Äôt even conceive that Donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldn‚Äôt write jokes bout Trump winning for election night. 
In the roughly two-hour discussion and Q&A titled ‚ÄúWow, That Was Weird,‚Äù Montclair Film Festival executive director Tom Hall set the somber tone by allowing, ""When we planned this evening, I think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face."" 
Speaking of the Late Show ‚Äôs Election Night special on Showtime, Colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired: 
There was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows: Hillary Clinton wins and we know; Hillary Clinton wins and we don‚Äôt know, because it‚Äôs not called before the show‚Äôs over; Donald Trump's going to win and we don‚Äôt know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. That's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. 
And then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. My execs and my writers were like, ‚ÄúYou don't want to write something for that?‚Äù and I'm like, ‚ÄúNo! There is nothing you can write. You don't understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter!‚Äù We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, ‚ÄúF‚Äî it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour.‚Äù So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. 
Colbert moaned that the special was ""the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,"" adding, ""I was tying my tie at 10:30 and I went, 'Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow! That's not expected.' And then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'Florida, Iowa, Nebraska.'"" He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but ""none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen."" 
As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives: 
He engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative ‚Äì after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative ‚Äì an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He out-Archie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious ‚ÄúColbert‚Äù who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist ‚ÄúColbert‚Äù who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colbert‚Äôs routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. 
On Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, ""I‚Äôm all for giving him a chance, but don‚Äôt give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And it‚Äôs horrifying. It's possible. The job changes a man. That's the cliche of the presidency."" He pontificated: 
Every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, ‚ÄúWell, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down.‚Äù But two things: One is they're cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. 
Everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, ‚ÄúShall I do it?‚Äù And they say, '‚ÄùYes.‚Äù And he says, ‚ÄúIt shall be so.‚Äù And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, ‚ÄúWhat do you think? Do you think I'm right?‚Äù That's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. And he's a vindictive person. So it's all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. ‚ÄúNo! There is nothing you can write."" Stephen Colbert 
Colbert concluded, ""The next person who says to me, 'You must be happy on a certain level,‚Äô is going to have their eye carved out.‚Äù 
So that‚Äôs the man underneath the comedy mask . . ."	bias

e8e9bc08d5b69a0f6c37139f0f2bb7b371ea3bf5	"Obama Won‚Äôt Go Away After He‚Äôs Done. That‚Äôs Good News. By: November 21, 2016 
So, soon-to-be-ex-President Obama won‚Äôt be going away anytime soon. 
After George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama; he didn‚Äôt sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland: he‚Äôll be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush ‚Äúcould not have been more gracious to me when I came in,‚Äù Obama said, ‚ÄúAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it‚Äôs necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I‚Äôll examine it when it comes.‚Äù 
This comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obama‚Äôs policy unpopularity ‚Äì and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas ‚Äì means that he‚Äôll suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obama‚Äôs obvious scorn for them. Here‚Äôs what Obama had to say about those who didn‚Äôt vote for Trump in today‚Äôs Der Spiegel : 
If you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. They're diverse. They believe in tolerance. They're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. 
This sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, he‚Äôll be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. He‚Äôll become the point of resistance for his own party ‚Äì and his party won‚Äôt be able to escape his shadow. 
Obama‚Äôs ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governor‚Äôs mansions. Now it may cost them the future.

With Donald Trump set to take office in a couple of months, a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration. As of this writing, there are three pro-Trump pundits that might be in the Trump administration. 
Eric Bolling. Politico reported that Bolling was seen at Trump Tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the Department of Commerce. What exactly that position that will be is not clear. Bolling told Politico that he ""can't confirm anything."" 
Geraldo Rivera flat-out asked Bolling on The Five if he had been offered a job, and Bolling gave a non-answer . 
Bolling has been with Fox News since 2008, where he is the co-host of The Five and hosts the weekend show Cashin' In . Before then, he had been an analyst on CNBC and a New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trader. Bolling has been an ardent supporter of Trump from the get-go, to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas . 
Laura Ingraham. According to CNN Money , Ingraham is being heavily considered for President Trump's press secretary. Here is what Ingraham has said on the matter: 
""I am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs. So we'll see what happens,"" Ingraham said on Fox News. 
She cautioned: ""I think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative."" But she strongly suggested that some sort of Trump administration post is in the works. 
""It's a big decision, but I'm at the point where, if my country needs me, and if I can do something to actually, you know, advance the Trump agenda, which is stuff I have written about now for 15 years, with trade, immigration and just renewing America, then I obviously have to seriously consider that,"" she told Fox's Tucker Carlson. 
Like Bolling, Ingraham, who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 2001 , has also been an early supporter of Trump, going as far as saying that #NeverTrump conservatives support partial birth abortion, and her website, LifeZette, attacked conservatives like Ben Shapiro for opposing the Alt-Right. (As usual, Shapiro punched back hard .) 
Jeanine Pirro. Pirro, accompanied by Rudy Giuliani, was seen headed inside Trump Tower, which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the Trump administration, according to Page Six . What that job would be is not known. 
Pirro also has been an early Trump supporter, and she has claimed to have known him for 30 years . Pirro's ex-husband, Al Pirro, has been described as ""a man Donald Trump keeps on retainer"" as a real-estate lawyer, and Trump once donated $20,000 to Pirro when she ran for New York state attorney general. 
Pirro has been with Fox News since 2006 and hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine on Saturdays. She also has an extensive legal career as a prosecutor in the state of New York and initially challenged Hillary Clinton when she ran for re-election in the Senate before dropping out to run for state attorney general.

For some people, fishing is a long, boring day of sitting and staring endlessly at a rod and reel that may never get a bite. But what if you could get down with those mocking water-breathers and have high-noon shoot-out with them the way nature intended? 
Well, that's just what some Florida boys thought when they decided to take their modified Glock 9mm pistol into the Gulf of Mexico to help deal with the infestation of Lionfish. 
TheSickest provides some more details on the Lionfish overpopulation problem and the boys' creative way to address it: 
""Lionfish are an invasive species with no natural predators who‚Äôs females lay a staggering two million eggs a year. The intersection between ammunition-happy Americans and the determent of an overpopulated species is where the the use of this new sporting phenomenon was birthed. 
Lionsfish were never intended to be in the Gulf of Mexico, and while its speculated that their transplant may be linked to a hurricanes back in the 90‚Äôs, because of their rapid reproductive nature the waters have become flooded by their presence. 
A single Lionsfish consumes 80% reef‚Äôs edible baitfish within five weeks of arriving on that reef ‚Äì incredibly damaging to plant that is the cornerstone of the underwater ecosystem. The issue has gotten to a point where entering the Florida coast at any time can mean running across thousands of Lionsfish, just posted up chilling. 
The good news is that the introduction of the gun has the potential of bringing hunters and otherwise uninterested fishers to the gulf for a fun filled time of shooting underwater, an activity that actually looks like a blast."" 
The video below shows just how fun it can be: 


""Shooting invasive Lionfish over 100ft underwater with customized Glock 9mm handgun in the Gulf of Mexico,"" the video description states.

While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. 
It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. 
The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. 
If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. 
Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8. 
As Trump pimps his new hotel, Hillary Clinton is pushing even harder to win the White House."	bias

Outside of tracking polls, Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt had a polling lead since July . Besides his brief July bump, Trump hasn‚Äôt led Clinton in national polling since May. What the media and Republicans don‚Äôt want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent.

Hopefully, as a country, we‚Äôll return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare. But this year, when the man at the top of the Republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses, isn‚Äôt likely to be that time. 
On Wednesday, former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh, a right-wing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show, followed his nominee‚Äôs lead and told urged his Twitter followers to grab their guns on Nov. 9 if Hillary Clinton is elected. 
Tweet: On November 8th, I‚Äôm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I‚Äôm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
This type of language from someone who used to be ‚Äì and thankfully no longer is ‚Äì a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but it‚Äôs also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. 
After all, not long ago Trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if Clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate Supreme Court judges. 
‚ÄúIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,‚Äù the Republican nominee said. ‚ÄúAlthough the Second Amendment people ‚Äî maybe there is, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù 
More recently, Trump said that he‚Äôd like to see what happens if Clinton‚Äôs bodyguards were disarmed. 
‚ÄúI think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTake their guns away, let‚Äôs see what happens to her.‚Äù 
Not only does Walsh‚Äôs rhetoric align perfectly with what Trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but it‚Äôs also a continuation of dangerous language that the former Republican congressman seems to enjoy using. 
Earlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in Dallas, Walsh blamed President Obama, tweeting: ‚ÄúThis is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.‚Äù 
Before Trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. Now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee. 
On Nov. 9, we shouldn‚Äôt hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election. We should hope that when Trump loses, he‚Äôll take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him."	bias

Since Republicans have essentially conceded that Donald Trump is going to lose the general election to Hillary Clinton, they‚Äôre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate Supreme Court justices. 
According to a report from the Huffington Post on Wednesday, one conservative thinker says that John McCain‚Äôs recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by Clinton isn‚Äôt that farfetched. 
The report: 
Some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCain‚Äôs controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton. 
Who needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all? 
‚ÄúAs a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,‚Äù wrote the Cato Institute‚Äôs Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist. 
Shapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nation‚Äôs highest court ‚Äï if not an entire branch of the federal government ‚Äï to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views. 
‚Ä¶ 
To Shapiro, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because ‚Äúthe Constitution is completely silent‚Äù on how the upper chamber provides its ‚Äúadvice and consent‚Äù on the president‚Äôs nominees. 
‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúSo when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate‚Äôs constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names,‚Äù he concluded. 
The original argument from Republicans was that they would block President Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the Nov. 8 election. Forget the fact that this isn‚Äôt how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. 
Now, faced with the growing prospect that Hillary Clinton will be elected the 45th President of the United States, they are beginning to change their tune. 
The obstruction that defined the Republican Party throughout Obama‚Äôs presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. It‚Äôs yet another reason why down-ballot races are more critical than ever this year."	bias

Ever since Donald Trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a Gold Star family and dishonoring the service of Captain Humayun Khan, he‚Äôs been trying out a new approach: pretending Khan would still be alive if he was president. 
Khan was killed in 2004 in a suicide attack in Iraq. 
When the Republican was asked in an interview with ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the Khan family following the Democratic National Convention, he repeated this bogus claim.

As Hillary Clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq from the beginning. Had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because Trump was in favor of it. 
In fact, Trump‚Äôs campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. This would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that America gets mired in more conflicts, not less. 
For their part, the Clinton campaign has continued to stand up to Trump‚Äôs attacks on the Khan family. In an emotional new ad released days ago, Capt. Khan‚Äôs father recounts how his son died protecting ‚Äúeveryone in his unit.‚Äù Khan‚Äôs father asked of Trump, ‚ÄúWould my son have a place in your America?‚Äù 
The answer to Mr. Khan‚Äôs question is a resounding ‚Äúno,‚Äù as Trump has promised to ban Muslims ‚Äì like the Khans ‚Äì from even entering the United States. For those living here already, a President Trump would treat them like criminals.

So Donald Trump has responded to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new D.C. hotel, a 263-room luxury hotel just blocks from the White House. Trump claims he used no undocumented workers ‚Äì and as we saw earlier , oh yeah, Hillary Clinton sleeps three days at a time. 
Trump‚Äôs decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows, not just in the Clinton camp. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt told MSNBC,

The Republican nominee protested to CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash , ‚ÄúFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop, and then she goes home and sleeps.‚Äù It is literally impossible for Trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else. 
Trump‚Äôs defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism: he ‚Äúworks all the time‚Äù while Clinton sleeps ‚Äúfor three days.‚Äù He says he took ‚Äúan hour off‚Äù (it was a bit more than that) to open his new hotel while ‚Äúshe wants to sleep all the time.‚Äù 
He says Clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days. In fact, Clinton made two ‚ÄúGet Out the Vote‚Äù stops in Florida yesterday; she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in North Carolina and has two appearances scheduled in Iowa for the day after. 
And Trump‚Äôs heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing, considering his track record in that regard. 
It is a fact, as Hillary Clinton said yesterday, that Donald Trump ‚Äúonce again‚Äù used undocumented labor to build a hotel. He used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower . And The Washington Post reports that ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs new downtown D.C. hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included Hispanic construction workers, including some workers who say they are undocumented .‚Äù Said one worker in 2015, ‚ÄúThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally.‚Äù 
The old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind, in reading Trump‚Äôs denial. This is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves, this remains true. 
Nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection, and it won‚Äôt work. Trump already has his clothing lines made in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of American jobs. 
Trump is a hypocrite, and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him, and certainly no recommendation for the office of president."	bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Over the past few months, there has been a dearth of good news, and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical American election. Where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change. Even dismissing the horrible flooding, wildfires, droughts, sea level rise, melting ice caps, hurricanes and worldwide food shortages, there have only been dire reports on the level of CO2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly record-setting rise in global temperatures. 
This week, while most Americans were living, breathing and bleeding over Donald Trump and the tortuously-long presidential campaign, the International Energy Agency offered up some good news; for the climate, the Earth‚Äôs population, and even for America. 
The good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on Tuesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that stated according to new data, for the first time ‚ÄúRenewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world.‚Äù 
It may not seem like such fantastic news, but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climate-ending 2-degree C rise in global temperatures, it is critical for the world to transition off of carbon-producing fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy generating sources. This is particularly true for getting off dirty coal-fired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of America‚Äôs C02 emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming. 
The IEA report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly two-thirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in, and coming from, developing and industrialized nations alike. For a developing nation, it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuel-generated power sources whether they are dirty coal-fired plants or not-quite-as-dirty natural gas-burning generating plants. 
The IEA also revised its earlier projections for renewable energy‚Äôs continued expansion and growth and ‚Äú significantly increased‚Äù the amount of ‚Äú green energy ‚Äù it expects to ‚Äú come on line ‚Äù over the next five years. Renewable energy includes so-called ‚Äúgreen‚Äù sources such as biomass, biogas, eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Both terms, ‚Äúrenewable and green energy,‚Äù include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable. 
In addition to pro-renewable policies (such as the Paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the America-China deal to roll back coal-generated emissions, there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables; particularly in solar. And, the IEA projected that the worldwide costs for solar-generated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years. Onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same five-year period. 
Although the IEA report was incredibly good news for the entire planet, there was some extra good news in the report about America‚Äôs transition to renewable energy. According to the IEA‚Äôs Medium-Term Renewable Market Report, the United States is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing. What that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the ever-increasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity. Still, America has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of America‚Äôs electricity. 
In time and if the Koch brothers allow it, America may catch up to still-developing nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources. Industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy. 
Although there appears to be no down-side in this bit of good news, the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications. The dirty coal industry is facing some struggles‚Ääin part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices, financial mismanagement, and new clean-air regulations, but the amount of CO2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity. It is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs. 
The IEA couldn‚Äôt pass up the chance to note one ‚Äústicking point‚Äù in their otherwise encouraging report; ‚Äú persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy ‚Äù that renewables are not affecting. However, since the IEA only monitored and tracked the world‚Äôs transistor from oil and gas to biofuels, they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world, they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener, significantly cheaper, and one Hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people. 
It is a mystery how Republicans beholden to the Koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry, particularly the dirty coal industry, will absorb this good news. In the past eight years, Republicans , the Kochs, their lobbyists at the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals. It is likely that the IEA‚Äôs report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome. But now that more Americans are benefitting from renewable energy, particularly solar, Republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the Sun and saving the climate for their children‚Äôs future; something the IEA‚Äôs report never mentions.

To compensate for this, Trump‚Äôs campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. ‚ÄúWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,‚Äù says a senior official. They‚Äôre aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. Trump‚Äôs invocation at the debate of Clinton‚Äôs WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are ‚Äúsuper predators‚Äù is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls‚Äîparticularly in Florida. 
The effort was obvious, and according to the polling, it is failing. 
Voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest Harvard IOP young voters poll. Sanders started flocking towards Clinton in August , and haven‚Äôt left, and early voting statistics show that African-American turnout is solid in swing states. 
The Trump campaign has realized that they don‚Äôt have enough supporters to win, so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states. 
However, for voter suppression efforts like Trump‚Äôs to be effective, the campaign must have a credible messenger. Donald Trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter, and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message. 
A voter suppression effort was expected from the Trump campaign. What is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it.

Donald Trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame. 
The Washington Post did an incredible story on Melanie Austin, a Trump supporter who said Trump sees the world like she does. She realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to ‚Äúcalm‚Äù her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against President Obama. 
The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a ‚Äúrant,‚Äù a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled ‚Äúmedical problem,‚Äù a doctor had typed ‚Äúhomicidal ideation.‚Äù 
Donald Trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected Republicans, have already pointed these folks at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Evil People Who Must Be Harmed. When you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as Trump and his advisers have done suggesting Hillary Clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence. 
Things are not going well for Trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and Fox News, they smell defeat.

This is political intimidation that mimics Donald Trump‚Äôs despotic promises to jail Clinton even though she‚Äôs been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless Republican investigations into her activities as Secretary of State. 
Of which there will be plenty more, Republicans promise us, should she win ‚Äî because just like the Trump camp doesn‚Äôt want you to vote, Republicans only want government to work when they‚Äôre not in power. 
The potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among Trump supporters.

In a story that sounds very familiar, former Miss Finland Ninni Laaksonen told the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that the now Republican nominee grabbed her butt just before Trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the Late Show with David Letterman in 2006. 
‚ÄúBefore the show we were photographed outside the building,‚Äù Laaksonen is quoted by Haaretz . ‚ÄúTrump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don‚Äôt think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, ‚ÄòWhat is happening?'‚Äù 
As to the veracity of these claims, it should be noted that Laaksonen didn‚Äôt seek the tabloid out. Ilta-Sanomat, the second largest paper in the country according to Wikipedia , reached out to Finnish women who had encountered Trump and that‚Äôs how they discovered her story. 
In case you‚Äôre not already grimacing, the former Miss Finland added, ‚ÄúSomebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger.‚Äù 
Trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of 35. Melania Trump is now 46, so she would have been ‚Äúexpired‚Äù when this alleged groping incident took place in 2006. 
New York Magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their ‚Äúp*ssy‚Äù against their will, so it‚Äôs not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the Trump machine. 
What should be alarming is that Donald Trump is the best of the best on the Republican bench. I mean, that is supposed to be how this works, right? A group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it. 
Republicans try to say this is just locker room talk, but if then Senator Barack Obama had had a bus tape like Trump‚Äôs, let alone 12 women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing, he not only wouldn‚Äôt be in office right now ‚Äì he wouldn‚Äôt have been a contender. Rightfully so."	bias

Donald Trump promised that he would bring millions of new Republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is Hillary Clinton who is getting new voters out to support her. 
Within their discussion of a new Pennsylvania poll showing Clinton leading Trump by 7 points, The New York Times reported: 
Mrs. Clinton has an 18-point lead among voters who did not participate in the 2012 election, according to our estimates, which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data. She fares even better among white voters who didn‚Äôt vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. It‚Äôs a pattern that has been true across all of the Upshot/Siena surveys in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. 
There has not been an influx of new voters who might help Mr. Trump. According to our estimates, Mrs. Clinton has a 16-point lead among newly registered voters. 
The idea that Trump was bringing millions of new voters to the Republican Party was always a myth. 
Donald Trump got the most votes of any candidate in a Republican presidential primary. Trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a Republican primary. Trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his party‚Äôs primary ballots cast against him. 
Hillary Clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters, and without a doubt, some of those voters have been motivated by Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign. 
Trump was right. He has brought millions of new voters to the polls. What he neglected to tell Republicans is that they are coming for Hillary Clinton."	bias

The Trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose Florida, they will lose the election, but the signs are evident in the polling that the Republican Party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the White House in November. 
A Trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for Republicans that leads to additional Democratic Senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority. Republicans could see their current record House majority gutted in a Clinton landslide. 
The election is not getting better for Republicans. The landscape is getting worse. If this polling continues for another week at the state level, Democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a Democratic White House, House and Senate being in play."	bias

Kimberly Ross wrote at Red State earlier this month that, 
I don‚Äôt believe that I, as an American woman, am oppressed. However, it is beyond disappointing that men who not only claim faith, but are in leadership roles, are so willing to dismiss a predator among them. Maybe Trump has promised them some future role? I don‚Äôt know. Regardless, they are lured away from doing their duty and instead join in with someone whose hobby is casting females aside. I‚Äôm disgusted by Trump and his male cheerleaders. You should be, too. Thankfully, women like Beth Moore and Rev. Lisa Sharon Harper won‚Äôt stay quiet on the sidelines as some Evangelical men have always wished they would. 
She is hardly alone, and more and more Evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from Trump. The reaction of Evangelical women, as Laurie Goodstein noted at The New York Times earlier this month, be a rift ‚Äúthat shapes politics for years.‚Äù 
It isn‚Äôt as if Trump hasn‚Äôt been saying these things all along. As David French protested at the National Review back in June, Trump ‚Äúsubverts all of our most cherished values.‚Äù The question is, what took them so long? 
Trump has already had an effect on the Religious Right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. He has 70 percent support from Evangelical men, but while Evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women.

And now Clinton has four times the cash. 
And The Washington Post is reporting that in the first 19 days of October, Trump only raised half as much as Clinton according to campaign finance reports. His biggest day was the $11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. 
Remember when Trump claimed he would give $100m of his own money to his campaign? Yeah, this is a guy who won‚Äôt even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. He uses other peoples‚Äô money for that. With the election just 10 days away, he has only donated $56m. 
Make what you will of this, but he had been giving $2m a month to his campaign. In the first 19 days of October? Just $31k in in-kind contributions. That‚Äôs right: even Trump won‚Äôt invest in his own campaign at this point. 
Trump pulled in $61m up to October 19, down from $100m in September. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign has pulled in a cool $101m in that same period. She spent less than normal, $54m, but that leaves her a war chest of $153m going into the final stretch. 
Donald Trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral (including hats) as he has on paying his staff. He says he gets only the best people. And he bought a lot of his #MAGA hats. His campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at $20 to $30 apiece. 
And according to Huffington Post , The October 15 Federal Election Commission filing for Trump Make America Great Again Committee shows Trump spent $300k of donors money to buy his own book ‚Äì presumably The Art of the Deal. He profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the $22 book at $184 each. 
His campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet Trump told a crowd in Geneva, Ohio that ‚ÄúHillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well I think that‚Äôs really, you know‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the White House while turning a personal profit.

Even Trump supporters are split 50%-49% on whether or not votes will be counted accurately. 
Part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that President Obama did in addressing these concerns, but it is most likely that voters are treating Trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election. 
One of the best indicators of a presidential election‚Äôs outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win. 
Hillary Clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election, which is a hint of the way that people are voting. 
The process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the US two party system. Losing candidates who refuse to go away, like Sarah Palin, are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up. 
Trump‚Äôs fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end. His words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level, which is why he still needs to be discussed, but as far as changing minds and winning an election, it looks voters are in the process of banishing Trump from the political island."	bias
c01e0b28c7077998468044b50ed570b23a8f88e7	"The Washington Post reported : 
Donald Trump raised just $29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of October, about half as much as his Democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign finance reports filed Thursday night showed. 
The GOP presidential nominee had just $16 million left in his campaign coffers on Oct. 19, compared to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs $62 million. When the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, Clinton‚Äôs war chest grew to $153 million, while Trump‚Äôs totaled $68 million. 
Trump‚Äôs total fundraising dropped 39% in the first 19 days of October. $29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. At a time when Trump needs boots on the ground to get out the Republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of $2 million. There isn‚Äôt going to be a last-minute ad blitz for Trump, or a reservation of television time so that the Republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. 
The plan for Trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for Trump‚Äôs ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. Trump promised to donate $100 million to his campaign but has only given $56 million . The billionaire who promised to self-finance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. Trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in October. 
Fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. The money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. Hillary Clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. Trump‚Äôs cash crush points to a depressed base that doesn‚Äôt expect him to win. 
Trump has done what he does best. He talked a big game while bankrupting the Republican Party for his own personal gain. Convincing Republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as Trump‚Äôs biggest con of all."	bias

When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. 
There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. 
Republicans can‚Äôt get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy.

If Donald Trump wants to keep Arizona in the Republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because Hillary Clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. 
The Clinton announced that the Democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in Arizona, ‚ÄúOn Wednesday, November 2, ‚Äé Hillary Clinton will campaign in Phoenix, Arizona, days before Election Day.

The fact that Clinton will be in usually reliably red Arizona in November during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. 
Hillary Clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. 
The Trump campaign already deployed VP nominee Mike Pence to Utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving Arizona to prevent Clinton from winning a state that has been a given for Republicans in previous elections. 
The Trump campaign is broke. The nominee had to give his campaign $10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads. 
The Clinton campaign is trying to stretch Trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for Arizona. It is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its Republican opponent at every turn."	bias

Candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by four points (48/44), and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy is tied with Republican incumbent Sen.

The poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubio‚Äôs Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. 
If Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubio‚Äôs national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
Democrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line.

Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs offensive to me, that kind of language. It‚Äôs not our operation,‚Äù Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe . 
Yes, Donald Trump‚Äôs Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he‚Äôs offended by, but it‚Äôs not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. 
Nope. 
Did Pence read the story? No. But he‚Äôs offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúour operation.‚Äù 
Watch here via MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe : 
Twice saying he hasn‚Äôt read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadn‚Äôt read, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs offensive to me, that kind of language. It‚Äôs not our operation,‚Äù Pence denied. 
‚ÄúDonald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And that‚Äôs our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but it‚Äôs going to take all of us.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd you saw Donald Trump ‚Ä¶ say that people who haven‚Äôt traditionally voted Republican, we‚Äôve got an agenda to bring our cities back‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Pence is twice offended, so super offended: 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because that‚Äôs just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. It‚Äôs not the approach we‚Äôre taking. We‚Äôre reaching out to every American.‚Äù 
Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Republicans to come home‚Äù because Trump won the primary. 
Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not what I see out there.‚Äù 
Trump also loves to cite what he ‚Äúsees‚Äù and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist ‚Äì like videos he claims to have watched. 
This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishment‚Äôs efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump don‚Äôt care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, it‚Äôs appalling in context. 
The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a woman‚Äôs ‚Äúp*ssy‚Äù without her permission, but he is publicly saying he‚Äôs offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
Pence didn‚Äôt even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesn‚Äôt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? 
Pence didn‚Äôt care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted ‚Äì not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
Like Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Donald Trump‚Äôs message that everything in the U.S. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only Trump can fix got slapped down today as the U.S. economy ‚Äúroars back‚Äù. 
The advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter of 2016 showed that the Obama economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9%. The conservative Wall Street Journal headlined this news with, ‚ÄúU.S. Economy Roars Back, Grew 2.9% in Third Quarter.‚Äù 
Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, summarized the numbers, ‚ÄúReal GDP grew 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending.‚Äù 
This news flies in the face of Donald Trump‚Äôs basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix. ‚ÄúThe Trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs website claims. 
Before these numbers, Trump‚Äôs previous problem was that Trump‚Äôs economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent, isn‚Äôt revenue neutral and would destroy 11 million jobs. Trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run. 
The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that Trump‚Äôs plan would cost the US trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by 10%-16%. Trump‚Äôs tax plan could cost the U.S. 11 million jobs. 
According to a report released at the end of July by Moody‚Äôs Analytics, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections. ‚ÄúThe analysis shows that, if implemented, the Democratic nominee‚Äôs agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent.‚Äù 
Under Trump‚Äôs plan, Moody‚Äôs estimated that unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million Americans would be put out of work. ‚ÄúThe U.S. economy will weaken significantly if Mr. Trump‚Äôs economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed,‚Äù the June report said. ‚ÄúThe economy will suffer a recession that begins in early 2018 and extends into 2020‚Ä¶even longer than the Great Recession.‚Äù 
Yikes. 
Trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts. Trump earned a ‚ÄúPants on Fire!‚Äù from PolitiFact for this claim made June 16th, 2015 in his presidential announcement speech, ‚ÄúThe last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product ‚Ä¶ was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It‚Äôs never below zero.‚Äù 
But also they note, ‚ÄúFinally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we‚Äôll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents.‚Äù 
Today‚Äôs new economic numbers help Clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under President Obama. 
Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jacob Leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs GDP release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years‚Ä¶ But Hillary Clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Independent experts agree her plan would create good-paying jobs through investments in infrastructure, innovation and education.‚Äù 
The economy is roaring back under President Obama, and the numbers suggest that it does better under a Democratic president. Donald Trump keeps saying Clinton is 4 more years of Obama, which makes a sunny case for her. 
Trump is already struggling with just 11 days to go until the election on November 8th, and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle. Reality has spoken, and it doesn‚Äôt agree with Donald Trump‚Äôs vision of America."	bias

The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trump‚Äôs DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump released a statement announcing their complaint: The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI‚Äôs decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton‚Äôs emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. 
‚ÄúIt is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,‚Äù said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. ‚ÄúIt is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
Outrage is growing over Comey‚Äôs actions as details about the FBI investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with Clinton, her emails, or her server. 
Director Comey‚Äôs motives for sending the letter 11 days before a presidential election have been questioned by both Republicans and Democrats. 
If Comey‚Äôs actions were politically motivated, he would be in violation of the Hatch Act. 
What Republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy. 
The American people deserve a full explanation from Director Comey, because the letter that was released today raises more questions than answers."	bias

So Donald Trump‚Äôs warnings about almost non-existent voter fraud were right after all. 
The only problem is that it was a Donald Trump supporter who committed voter fraud by voting twice. 
Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into jail Thursday on a felony charge of first-degree election misconduct after being arrested for suspicion of voting twice, according to the Des Moines Register . 
Authorities say the registered Republican cast two electoral ballots in Polk County. She was held in jail on a $5,000 bond and released Friday.

This does make it pretty awkward for Republicans, especially Trump supporters who‚Äôve been told to ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù areas where liberals and Democrats vote, which is actually called voter intimidation and is also against the law. 
In fact, Donald Trump‚Äôs unfounded claims that the election is rigged got the Republican Party sued for voter intimidation. And now one of Trump‚Äôs own supporters is arrested over voter fraud. 
Makes sense."	bias

Former DOJ spokesman for Eric Holder Matthew Miller, a self described ‚Äúrecovering flack from DOJ, DSCC‚Äù, schooled Republican FBI Director James Comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. 
‚ÄúThe department and the FBI have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and Director Comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case,‚Äù Miller said on CNN. ‚ÄúBut this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election, and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last 60 days let alone the last 11 days.‚Äù 
Watch here: 
Miller also held school on Twitter about Comey‚Äôs abuse of power, which has led to Hillary Clinton having to defend against a negative: I wrote a piece in July on why Comey's public comments about Clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power. 1/ https://t.co/G8croz4qWZ

The problem with Comey‚Äôs actions isn‚Äôt that he is investigating Hillary Clinton; the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election. It is an established rule that ongoing investigations aren‚Äôt commented on for obvious reasons. 
This is quite simply not done. Comey‚Äôs reasons for doing this are unclear, and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense. But it‚Äôs troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rules/agreements of law surrounding the Trump campaign, which seems to have lowered the bar all around.

Earlier this week Friday Fox Follies , under the assumption the explosive , and bizarre battle between Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich, would be this week‚Äôs lede , I had already tricked up an opening paragraph. In case you missed it , that‚Äôs when he got personal , accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues . This week‚Äôs column would have been about how the Fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election. The NYT calls ‚Äôem Megyn Moments ; I call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù Channel: it‚Äôs unthinking audience. 
Then came word that Rupert Murdoch was playing hardball as Kelly‚Äôs contract negotiations break out into the open. That paragraph, lovingly crafted, went out the window. But, let‚Äôs see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings, as Trump Congratulates Newt Gingrich For Getting His Butt Kicked By Megyn Kelly . Watch: 
As Kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof , Rupert Murdoch seems desperate to keep her. Her contract expires next year and Rupie opened up to the Wall Street Journal ‚Äî of which he is owner ‚Äî to partially cajole Kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract. Million in Contract Talks With Fox News 
‚ÄúIf they are going to make a network that is going to be a post-Ailes/post-Trump, it will be around Megyn Kelly, Chris Wallace and Shep Smith, and they are going to have to throw Hannity and O‚ÄôReilly overboard,‚Äù said Andrew Tyndall, a television-news consultant, of other hosts at the network. That isn‚Äôt going to happen, promised Mr. Murdoch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not changing direction‚Ä¶that would be business suicide,‚Äù he said. Mr. O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs contract is also up at the end of next year, and Mr. Murdoch said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to want Bill to stay with us.‚Äù Mr. Hannity‚Äôs contract isn‚Äôt up until 2020. Ms. Kelly has forged close ties to Mr. Murdoch‚Äôs sons, particularly Lachlan Murdoch, who is co-executive chairman of Fox and has taken an active role in contract talks, people close to the situation said. 
Fox would like to settle this before the election and before Kelly‚Äôs book is released, both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well. 
From the The Power of Megyn Kelly‚Äôs Feminism‚ÄîEven if She Doesn‚Äôt Call It That , by The Daily Beast‚Äôs Tim Teeman : 
Imagine, then, her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise-ridden screeds out today: ‚ÄúHow Megyn Kelly Became an Improbable Feminist Icon‚Äù (Vanity Fair); ‚ÄúMegyn Kelly Has Become The Biggest Example of White Feminism At Work (Pajiba); and ‚ÄúAw Crap‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Proof That Megyn Kelly Is Kind of a Feminist Role Model Now‚Äù (The Stir). Note the grudging headlines. Because of Kelly‚Äôs employer, and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional, left-wing context throughout her career to date, the F-word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl. This, in itself, reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of Kelly‚Äôs critics: It is perfectly possible to work for a right-facing institution and not be 100 percent right wing yourself, or spout the prevailing dogma of the TV station you work for. (Full disclosure: I worked for The Times of London, a British, Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, for over 13 years.) 
Aside from the fact that when she tilts Right, she tends to tilt alt-right, the biggest knock on Kelly is that she‚Äôs too hard-edged. Marshall McLuhan spoke of the Medium Cool of tee vee, but Kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy . This makes her less attractive to other networks. She‚Äôs hoping to change that impression when she co-hosts Live with Kelly Ripa (The Kelly & Kelly Show?) the morning after the election . Think of her as a designated hitter, trying to knock Murdoch‚Äôs hardball right out of the park. 
STILL WATTERS STILL: A few weeks back FFF reported on a racist Watters World in which the White Privileged Pencil-Necked Geek made fun of Asians. This week Asian American groups meet with Fox News personnel over awful Jesse Watters segment : 
Paul Cheung, president of AAJA, told the Erik Wemple Blog that the meeting was ‚Äúproductive.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think they heard what the community‚Äôs reactions are,‚Äù he said of the session at New York‚Äôs Museum of Chinese in America. Approximately 130 Asian American ‚Äúgroups and allies‚Äù have signed an open letter to Fox News regarding the unfortunate episode, said Cheung. Ron Kim, a New York state assemblyman in attendance, told this blog that a representative from ‚ÄúThe O‚ÄôReilly Factor‚Äù and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting. Together they played a ‚Äúgood cop, bad cop‚Äù routine, said Kim. ‚ÄúThe gentleman from O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of Fox News and sometimes edgy humor can go too far,‚Äù said Kim. Once again, the specter of Fox News‚Äôs vaunted news-opinion divide presents itself. As we‚Äôve noted before, this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify Fox News hosts such as Sean Hannity openly campaigning for Donald Trump, Steve Doocy of the morning show ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù spreading harmful innuendo into the public square ‚Ä¶ and O‚ÄôReilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about Chinatown."	bias
2a892df9d2621e4f2db0b4449541e3f30cf9625b	"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 7:56 am ""If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn't going away. So what needs to happen, special prosecutor? She can't investigate herself as the president-elect""   
President Barack Obama did not have to do anything wrong for Republicans to want to throw him in jail, or to impeach him. Hillary Clinton doesn‚Äôt have to have done anything wrong either, apparently, for Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected ‚Äì because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her . 
At least, that and completely ignoring the facts, was the theme on Fox News last night, though to be fair, other mainstream media outlets weren‚Äôt much better yesterday. 
Megyn Kelly, fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a face-off with Newt Gingrich, suggested to Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte (R-WV) that given the FBI revelations of a complete lack of evidence that Hillary Clinton has done anything wrong, ‚Äúwhat needs to happen‚Äù is a special prosecutor. 
MEGYN KELLY : Let me ask you this. If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn‚Äôt going away. So what needs to happen, [a] special prosecutor? She can‚Äôt investigate herself as the president-elect. BOB GOODLATTE : Well, first of all, we have said from the outset that the House Judiciary Committee would follow the truth wherever it leads, and we have done that throughout the summer, asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the FBI was being conducted. We will continue to do that. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen now. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen after the election. So it‚Äôs pure speculation what will happen afterwards. A special prosecutor, remember, is appointed by the Attorney General of the United States. So, you have to decide whether that‚Äôs going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the FBI under the direction of Director Comey right now. And the Judiciary Committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation. 
Democracy is a fragile thing. It is to Goodlatte‚Äôs credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in 2014 and that he cautioned Megyn Kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the House but by the Attorney General. However, the GOP-led House has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy. 
What holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works. Republicans have decided it only works if they‚Äôre in charge, and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries, appoint special prosecutors if they win, or vote to impeach them outright, as Trump‚Äôs pet snake at CNN, Jeffrey Lord, called for last night : 
Two points, Anderson. One, with 11 days left, this makes Donald Trump‚Äôs argument exactly to the point here, you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment, her paranoia and all of the rest. The second thing, Anderson is, and this is the really disturbing thing, let‚Äôs just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election, this isn‚Äôt going to stop. There will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that Bible. This is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly, I mean that‚Äôs something the American people need to consider now. 
It is not difficult to see where this will lead. Hillary Clinton has committed no crimes. Far from being a miscarriage of justice, though it is that as well, this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity. 
This sort of talk is just further evidence that Donald Trump comes from the same vile brew as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the rest of the party. During the McCarthy era, the House took it upon itself to be both judge and jury. Last night, it was Fox News egging the House on for more of the same. 
This sort of talk is deplorable, it is reprehensible, and it is dangerous ‚Äì and strikes at the very heart of our democracy."	bias

Even though early polling shows there hasn‚Äôt been an impact in swing states , and even though the majority of Americans have already made up their minds, each time her emails are brought up Hillary Clinton falls in the polls. 
A Gallup poll showed that ‚Äúemails‚Äù are the most Americans have heard about Clinton. Not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them ‚Äî but the emails that she was already cleared on. 
Even though one result of the Comey letter has been to energize Clinton supporters , at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency, this still isn‚Äôt an acceptable practice. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent, obviously would impact an election that was then just 11 days out and is now 10 days out, and actually bore no information‚Äì well, that‚Äôs inaccurate. The letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared, but the damage has already been done. 
While Ron Fournier and others suggested that Democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by Comey was just more partisan folly, the truth is even more disturbing. 
By even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan, we are allowing the press to enable Republicans to continue pretending there is no reality. 
In reality, no matter which side of the aisle you are on, it‚Äôs a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election. The reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties ‚Äî for instance, it‚Äôs obvious that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign for coordination with Russia, but we don‚Äôt headline that because the FBI hasn‚Äôt commented on that, because‚Ä¶ 
To do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections. 
So it‚Äôs really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan, even as the Trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule. If the rule applies to Donald Trump, it should apply to Hillary Clinton. 
Asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan. 
We must stick to reality. We must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable Republicans to keep drinking the no-fact Kool-Aid. 
The press did the Republican smoke is a real fire thing all through President Obama‚Äôs terms, at one point claiming he was implicated in Benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a Republican aide to read him said emails ‚Äî and of course, it turned out that the emails didn‚Äôt say what the aide told the reporter. But that was learned much later and as everyone knows, a lie travels faster than the truth. 
And now American voters in swing states who read papers will think the FBI is investigating Clinton. 
So Comey‚Äôs letter did damage Hillary Clinton. Even if she wins the election, the letter damaged her and down ballot Democrats. 
The media never learns. They take Republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact, every time. They look like fools to those who know there was no there in the Comey letter, but the average voter doesn‚Äôt live for political updates. 
The irresponsible damage is done.

In a conference call with reporters, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager said that FBI Director Comey‚Äôs letter is backfiring and energizing Clinton‚Äôs volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers. 
Clinton campaign chair John Podesta called Comey‚Äôs letter long on innuendo, short on facts. Podesta said the more information that comes out, the more this seems overblown. Podesta went off on Rep. Jason Chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened. Podesta said that Comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts. 
Podesta said there‚Äôs no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing. He said if all the media reports are true, about the investigation having nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, it‚Äôs hard to see how this amounts to anything. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chair called on Comey to provide answers to be public. 
Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that the Comey letter is motivating Clinton volunteers and supporters: 
Based on the anecdotes I am hearing from out team on the ground, this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election. Our volunteers are rallying around Hillary They know what a fighter she is. 
‚Ä¶. 
They are turning out, not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote, as early voting goes into full swing. We‚Äôre not just seeing this in our offices, on the ground, but also in our online, in the online space as well. I think this is; we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday. I think that this has only increased the momentum that we‚Äôre feeling among our activists on the ground. 
Later Mook suggested that the Comey letter is helping the Clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire. It is likely that the Comey letter will backfire on Republicans and motivate Democrats to get out and support their nominee. 
An early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters. Hillary Clinton may end up benefiting from Comey‚Äôs actions because the FBI Director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her.

A newly surfaced video via Ryan Grim shows the Trump Humiliation game in action, which I walk everyone through from the POV of the woman. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
If you‚Äôre a woman who‚Äôs worked in any business where you‚Äôre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive, vulgar man in power, you will know exactly what‚Äôs about to happen in this video. 
Donald Trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. And there‚Äôs a newly surfaced video via Ryan Grim at Huffington Post that shows the Trump Humiliation game in action. 
In the video, Trump publicly sexualizes and shames the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia, Jennifer Hawkins as revenge. Before he does it, Trump tells the audience, ‚ÄúGet even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.‚Äù 
Watch this newly surfaced 2011 corporate speech here via Huffington Post (major trigger warning if you‚Äôve been there): 
Watching this you see the Trump modus operandi in action. This is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning Trump‚Äôs advances. The harassment as revenge. The sexual shaming. 
Trump sets the audience up for the Roman Gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should ‚Äúscrew‚Äù people back if they ‚Äúscrew‚Äù you. The sexually angry verb foreshadows what‚Äôs to come, because he is going to ‚Äúscrew‚Äù Jennifer Hawkins in public, when she realizes that because it‚Äôs public, she can‚Äôt further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions. 
Trump says he‚Äôs going to give them an example of his revenge theory, ‚ÄúJennifer Hawkins.‚Äù 
Trump orders Hawkins to the stage. The audience cheers and jeers, delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl. It‚Äôs to be a public spanking. So much fun. 
‚ÄúFirst of all, how beautiful is Jennifer,‚Äù Trump asks, claiming ownership of Jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. The message: He can make or break her. She better play nice. 
Warning shot, ‚ÄúThis is about getting even.‚Äù 
Trump tells the audience that he was mad at Hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in Sydney. He tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as she‚Äôs crossing the stage, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my favorite Miss Universe.‚Äù So she thinks maybe this isn‚Äôt going to be as bad as she fears. 
But then he stabs her publicly for the first time, ‚ÄúBut I think I like the new one better.‚Äù 
The audience loves it. He is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasn‚Äôt a good girl. She reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. 
Hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing Trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. It won‚Äôt be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. She will have to pay. 
‚ÄúI was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she‚Äôs not very bright,‚Äù Trump tells the audience, signaling that Hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. 
‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt have been true, but I would have said it anyway,‚Äù Trump proudly tells the audience. This is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesn‚Äôt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. But in the mind of little men like Trump, this makes him a winner. 
Trump points out that Hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. He owns her. She must comply or face his wrath. Hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but Trump pushes her away from the microphone. This public shaming will be done from Trump‚Äôs POV only. No need for Hawkins to assert her personhood.There will be no defense allowed, because she‚Äôs already guilty. 
‚ÄúAnd you know what? She came tonight, she came ‚Äî came, she came, she came,‚Äù Trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at Christmas. He waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. They get it. Hee heee. So clever. Came. Knuckles dragging on the floor clever. 
‚ÄúSee, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia,‚Äù Trump says. 
Trump grabs Hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the Bush tape. 
Hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. The kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. She is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. She‚Äôs allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. The repulsive kiss. 
I‚Äôm telling this story as I imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. Of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. The world is full of men like Trump, and they stick together. See Roger Ailes. Women have to play along and appease and if that doesn‚Äôt work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. 
I can only do this because I have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. And I have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. 
From talking to so many women during this election, I know that I‚Äôm not alone. I know that many other women will watch this and know. They will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. How dare Hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce Trump. 
And other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. They will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like Trump. Ironically, if you give in you‚Äôre not humiliated. It‚Äôs only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. 
It‚Äôs not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like Donald Trump bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. It‚Äôs the public humiliation and denigration. 
It‚Äôs the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. 
It‚Äôs the way she tries to make it okay, to sweet-smooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her ‚Äúcome‚Äù and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. 
If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but it‚Äôs not all Trump‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the culture‚Äôs fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
In fact, this is shades of what Trump did to Hillary Clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed. 
Neither are we by you, Mr. Trump. Neither are we."	bias

Geoff Garin of Hart Research tweeted from the field: Still early, but I was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the Comey letter. 
‚Äî Geoff Garin (@geoffgarin) October 29, 2016 
It is still early, but if this were the election shifting news that Republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate. The reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign, it will be because Republicans are coming back to Trump. 
There are few undecided voters in this election, and even if all the Republican base come home to Trump, it won‚Äôt be enough for Trump to win, because he is losing where the presidential election is really held. Trump is getting crushed at the state level. 
Republicans have been trying to build Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails into a story for years, and they have failed at every turn. 
Hillary Clinton led the election while under Congressional investigation. Hillary Clinton led the election while under FBI investigation. Hillary Clinton is leading the election today. The message that Republicans and the media don‚Äôt want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails, and they don‚Äôt care. 
Voters are smarter than Republicans and the press give them credit for. The Hillary Clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that Clinton did anything wrong. 
If the polls tighten a little, this will be the best news in the world for Hillary Clinton and Democrats, because it will destroy any potential for Democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls. 
What Geoff Garin witnessed is probably going to end up being very accurate. James Comey‚Äôs letter to Congress is unlikely to move swing states and change the outcome of the presidential election."	bias

The FBI is examining how a Hillary Clinton aide handled emails. The examination has nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, her emails, or her email server. 
According to Newsweek‚Äôs Kurt Eichenwald, the ‚Äúscandal‚Äù is related to the process Clinton aide Huma Abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read. 
Eichenwald reported: Because Clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen, emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home, where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent. Abedin, like many State Department officials, found the government network technology to be cumbersome, and she had great trouble printing documents there, investigative records show. As a result, she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified State Department account to either her Yahoo account or her account on Clinton‚Äôs server, and printed the emails from there. It is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husband‚Äôs campaign. 
Abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed Clinton needed to see and when the Secretary forwarded emails to her for printing. Abedin told the FBI she would often print these emails without reading them. Abedin printed a large number of emails this way, in part because, investigative records show, other staff members considered her Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù and often sent Abedin electronic communications they wanted the Secretary to see. 
The entire scandal is about how emails were printed. It has nothing to do with how Hillary Clinton handled emails or classified information. The investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for Hillary Clinton to read. No wonder Comey didn‚Äôt provide more details in his letter to Congress. The details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the FBI. 
There is no evidence that Clinton‚Äôs aide committed a crime. For the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal, there must be evidence that Abedin intended to leak classified information. There remains zero evidence of criminal activity. 
The FBI examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the 2016 election , and Comey‚Äôs behavior is a disgrace to the US intelligence community. 
The new information destroys Republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat . Republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails, but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat. 
The emails won‚Äôt change anything in 2016, but they will give Congressional Republicans a reason to keep investigating Hillary Clinton in 2017 and beyond. In other words, James Comey is already delegitimizing Hillary Clinton‚Äôs potential presidency."	bias

Video: 
At a rally in Golden, CO, Trump said:

I have real problems, so get your ballots in. 
Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. 
Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. 
Consider the contradiction in Trump‚Äôs message. The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. 
If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in? 
It is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense. Trump‚Äôs inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why Republicans on pace to lose this election.

Although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their ‚Äú imagined ‚Äù close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. 
It is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chief‚Äôs tolerance during an election. 
The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either ‚Äú belated rejection ‚Äù or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that ‚Äú Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of [GOP] toxic hostility .‚Äù It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that ‚Äú Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him ,‚Äù but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at Republicans. 
Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the President‚Äôs approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. 
Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President ‚Äúto break the grip of heroin addiction.‚Äù President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for, 
‚Äú Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump ,‚Äù but only ‚Äú After looking at the polling. Now that it‚Äôs politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week? So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists ‚Ä¶ and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn‚Äôt quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK? And now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump. ‚Äù 
The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President ‚Äú one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,‚Äù California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the President‚Äôs face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama ‚Äú to protect victims of sexual assault .‚Äù 
Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the President‚Äôs wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issa-created scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the President‚Äôs image on it. The President said, 
‚Äú Issa‚Äôs primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah.‚Äù 
As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable, ‚Äú He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight years‚Äîto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans‚Äô faces .‚Äù 
The President clearly has a lot of ‚Äú words ‚Äù to harangue Republicans with. He said , 
‚Äú Here‚Äôs the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasn‚Äôt born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybody‚Äôs guns away! They said that while we were doing military exercises that we‚Äôve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what they‚Äôve been saying for years now! So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe it‚Äôs true! And if the world they‚Äôve been seeing is I‚Äôm powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybody‚Äôs guns in the middle of the night and impose martial law‚Äîeven though I can‚Äôt talk without a ‚Äòprompter‚Äîthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump? 
And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what this‚Äôll help rile up the base, it‚Äôll give us an excuse to obstruct what we‚Äôre trying to do, we won‚Äôt be able to appoint judges, we‚Äôll gum up the works, we‚Äôll create gridlock, it‚Äôll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didn‚Äôt start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. That‚Äôs what he always does. And so now, when suddenly it‚Äôs not working and people are saying wow this guy‚Äôs kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly they‚Äôre all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly that‚Äôs a deal-breaker. Well what took you so long! What the heck! What took you so long! All these years!‚Äù 
The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or ‚Äú revenge ‚Äù against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the President‚Äôs head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. 
The President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer; and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House."	bias

Gabriel Sherman writes at New York Mag that when Donald Trump attacked the Khan family over Khizr Khan‚Äôs speech at the Democratic National Convention, he had no idea what a Gold Star family was. 
You will remember that Khizr Khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to Donald Trump, ‚ÄúLet me ask you, ‚ÄòHave you even read the United States Consitution?‚Äô I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words ‚Äòliberty‚Äô and ‚Äòequal protection of the law.‚Äô‚Äù 
The fallout was predictable. Donald Trump, openly criticized, lost it. He attacked the Khan‚Äôs religious beliefs, saying ‚ÄúIf you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn‚Äôt allowed to have anything to say.‚Äù 
Now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing. Because he is ignorant, and because, as Mark Cuban has observed, he isn‚Äôt interested in learning anything. Gabriel Sherman explains: 
‚ÄúYou do know you just attacked a Gold Star family?‚Äù one adviser warned Trump. Trump didn‚Äôt know what a Gold Star family was: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù he asked. To Trump, Khizr Khan and his wife, Ghazala, were enemies who had said something mean about him, just like Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years. Wasn‚Äôt it his right to respond? ‚Äú‚ÄÖ‚ÄòThe election is about the American people, it‚Äôs not about you,‚Äô‚ÄÖ‚Äù Manafort told Trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Trump countered with Breitbart‚Äôs report on Khan‚Äôs purported belief in Sharia. ‚Äú‚ÄÖ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not running for president,‚Äô‚ÄÖ‚Äù Manafort shot back. ‚Äú‚ÄÖ‚ÄòThe Clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message.‚Äô‚ÄÖ‚Äù 
Of course, Trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasn‚Äôt prepared to take the blame. Instead, as Sherman reveals, he ‚Äútook it out on Manafort in front of his senior advisors, including Ailes.‚Äù According to Trump, Manafort wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúable to get the media to focus on the right stuff.‚Äù 
No wonder, when Trump refuses to take Manafort‚Äôs advice and focus on the right stuff. This is not to defend Manafort, who is at least as despicable as his boss, but it serves as an example of how Trump‚Äôs first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic. 
It was one of Donald Trump‚Äôs most visible Joe McCarthy moments, and his response to Khizr Khan actually reinforced the point Khan was trying to make. 
Stopping and thinking are foreign to him. And if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here, you should not be. This is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts."	bias

It may be the understatement of the year to say the Republican Party is on the verge of a full-on civil war, and it may be obvious to many Americans that the blame for the inter-party discord is its standard bearer Donald J. Trump. However much Trump‚Äôs candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trump‚Äôs reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded Trump supporters, the real instigators are the Koch brothers. 
Although the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nation‚Äôs political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. The tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A. Boehner out of Congress, morphed into the inaptly- named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isn‚Äôt solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job, although that is high on the Trump supporters‚Äô to-do list. 
As noted in Wednesday‚Äôs New York Times, ‚Äú Mr. Trump‚Äôs supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress ‚Äî a target many of them seem‚Ä¶eager to take down .‚Äù 
The right-wing extremist that actually ‚Äú took down ‚Äù former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat, issued a warning to establishment Republicans: 
‚Äú There‚Äôs a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to D.C. Leadership comes and smacks our guy? That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre going to put down a marker? Really? And the American people are just scratching their head saying, ‚ÄòReally? That‚Äôs rich .‚Äô‚Äù 
Brat has been a thorn in the establishment‚Äôs side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of ‚Äú real conservatives ‚Äù who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton. 
Donald Trump and a few of his ‚Äú senior aides ‚Äù are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump. In fact, besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump, it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy. And, during an interview with Reuters he complained that ‚Äú The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top .‚Äù Win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a Herculean task to save the party. 
This impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. The chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a ‚Äútrue conservative‚Äù intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. And ‚Äúuber-conservative‚Äù is just a different way of saying a ‚Äú non-government ‚Äù according to the Koch brothers‚Äô vision of American libertarianism. Don‚Äôt believe it? 
Two groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers, Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks , have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the party‚Äôs decisions; something establishment types are resisting. 
Over the past few days, leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the House; something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome. 
According to the chief executive of Heritage Action, Michael Needham, there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they don‚Äôt bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump. Mr. Needham said, 
‚Äú If the party doesn‚Äôt learn lessons and change based on what‚Äôs gone on for the last year and a half, I think it‚Äôs going to be just catastrophe .‚Äù 
Another conservative extremist, House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needham‚Äôs sentiment and said, ‚Äú You can‚Äôt ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle. ‚Äù 
The dilemma for Republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. That doesn‚Äôt seem likely because if Trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trump‚Äôs more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. If Trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans. 
The Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger. After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by Donald Trump, the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party."	bias

By Roberta Rampton 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) ‚Äì Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. 
Jennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach ‚Äì and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system ‚Äì a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote 
Celebrity-driven events like the concert ‚Äúcan serve as a bit of a distraction‚Äù from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. 
‚ÄúIt is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,‚Äù Kasper said. 
The JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. 
A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show ‚ÄúThe Apprentice.‚Äù 
But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year‚Äôs race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. 
Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book ‚ÄúWhat Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.‚Äù 
‚ÄúCampaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,‚Äù said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. 
The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a ‚Äúgroundswell‚Äù of support behind a candidate ‚Äì and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. 
‚ÄúIt can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,‚Äù Kasper said.

7a9ffd4f7332a7671a46dbd5ce95ace264ff8eca	"By Reuters   6:34 pm Democrat Hillary Clinton's top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading ""innuendo.""   
By Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo. (Reuters) ‚Äì Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading ‚Äúinnuendo.‚Äù 
Comey, who has headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2013, notified the U.S. Congress on Friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in July it decided not to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. 
John Podesta, who heads Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, told reporters that Comey‚Äôs letter to Congress was ‚Äúlight on facts, heavy on innuendo,‚Äù and he urged Comey to ‚Äúcome forward and give those answers to the American public‚Äù about the exact nature of the FBI‚Äôs latest review of emails. 
Sources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. 
Weiner, a former U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. 
With the Nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. 
‚ÄúHer criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful,‚Äù Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. ‚ÄúHillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure.‚Äù 
Comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. 
Clinton‚Äôs campaign tried to play down the new review. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing,‚Äù Podesta said, in the FBI‚Äôs latest announcement that it was taking ‚Äúappropriate investigative steps‚Äù after learning of emails ‚Äúthat appear to be pertinent‚Äù to the earlier probe. 
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already ‚Äúfactored‚Äù what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see it changing the landscape‚Äù for undecided voters, Mook said. 
Clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. 
Clinton was campaigning in Florida on Saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say Trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. 
In recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. 
Justice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI director‚Äôs letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. 
While Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. 
Comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBI‚Äôs probe of Clinton‚Äôs emails, the source said. 
Meanwhile, Clinton supporters rallied to her defense following Friday‚Äôs FBI disclosure. 
The Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, held a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, and urged Comey to release more details.

By Maurice Tamman 
NEW YORK (Reuters) ‚Äì With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. 
Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas. 
An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Florida‚Äôs United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. 
Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed. 
Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clinton‚Äôs close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedin‚Äôs estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. 
It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. 
Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. 
As of Thursday, Clinton‚Äôs odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. 
Clinton‚Äôs lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romney‚Äôs 206. 
But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trump‚Äôs accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager‚Äôs account. This week‚Äôs leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clinton‚Äôs finances. 
And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didn‚Äôt see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. 
Still, Trump‚Äôs path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. 
Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The project‚Äôs broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. 
In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. 
In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. 
Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results. 
The States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. State by state results are available by visiting http://www.reuters.com/statesofthenation/

Not only is Donald Trump a liar and a thin-skinned crybaby, but he is selfish, never spending his own money when he can spend somebody else‚Äôs. This behavior was never more in evidence than The Washington Post ‚Äòs David Fahrenthold‚Äôs account of a 1996 a ribbon-cutting held by the Association to Benefit Children for a nursery school, when Donald Trump showed up, sat down to appear to be a great supporter, and then left without leaving a donation: 
As Sopan Deb tweeted , 
‚Äî Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 29, 2016 
Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford were big donors and it is no wonder Gifford was so shocked by Trump‚Äôs presence. What had been exposed is that Trump‚Äôs life is a sham, a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not. 
As Fahrenthold explains , 
For as long as he has been rich and famous, Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public ‚Äî even nationally televised ‚Äî promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A months-long investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trump‚Äôs boasts about his philanthropy. 
That philanthropist isn‚Äôt the real Trump. The only person Trump visibly cares about is Donald Trump. He uses his Foundation to buy himself nice things, spending other peoples‚Äô money for luxury items and collectibles. When he does make donations, it is again, because he gives no money to his own Foundation, with other peoples‚Äô money. 
Fahrenthold says that the only donation of Trump‚Äôs own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today, is a $10,000 ‚Äúgift to the Police Athletic League of New York City, in 2009.‚Äù 
For a man as rich as Trump claims to be, $10,000 in eight years is nothing to brag about. Not that this stops the monumental, deadbeat hypocrite that is Donald Trump from bragging anyway."	bias

Coming from people who believe in something called ‚Äúspiritual warfare‚Äù‚Äì a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions ‚Äì it is perhaps no surprise that the Religious Right should declare that their messiah ‚Äì Donald Trump ‚Äì is being threatened with witchcraft. 
Lance Wallnau, whose Twitter page claims to be ‚ÄúYour Spiritual Warfare Guide to the 2016 Election,‚Äù appeared on ‚ÄúThe Jim Bakker Show‚Äù to push the crazy idea that ‚Äúmany Christians feel this fog on their head at times‚Äù and ‚Äúthat fog that‚Äôs on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there‚Äôs spirits being authorized to be released.‚Äù 
Watch courtesy of Right Wing Watch: 
Oh sweet baby Jesus, the mighty Lance has struck out. What has happened, of course, is that the Religious Right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. It‚Äôs no wonder they feel in a fog . Metaphorically or physically, they‚Äôre selling their souls. 
Wallnau claims ‚ÄúThe left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of Christ who doesn‚Äôt work together,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the dilemma that America‚Äôs in right now,‚Äù even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the Religious Right has been organizing since Goldwater lost in ‚Äô64 . 
A hypocrite just can‚Äôt catch a break, it seems: 
The web literally is coming down on America. And what‚Äôs sad is, how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times? Do you feel that? It‚Äôs almost like everything‚Äôs going wrong. We don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the American culture and discipling the country. And that fog that‚Äôs on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there‚Äôs spirits being authorized to be released. 
Wherever there‚Äôs agreement, there‚Äôs power. The more unbelievers agree with the narrative that they‚Äôre hearing, the more power and authorization Satan has to manifest. So unless the church has an exposure of what the enemy‚Äôs doing and begins to agree together with a counter-strategy, we‚Äôre going to deal with more and more fog. And the worst part is‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have to surrender nations to the devil. 
So if you disagree with Wallnau, if you oppose Trump, it can only because you‚Äôre manifesting the power of Satan (who in the Old Testament is God‚Äôs lieutenant, not his adversary). So pick your Testament, I suppose. 
Lance Wallnau insists he is ‚Äúnot a big conspiracy theorist buff,‚Äù but this doesn‚Äôt do anything to convince us he‚Äôs not some wack-a-doodle instead. This is nothing new, as a non-Christian being told that you represent a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù you don‚Äôt even believe exists. 
There are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize (or worse) their opponents. 
Without charges of Satanism and witchcraft, you don‚Äôt have the genocide of European and Middle Eastern Paganism; you don‚Äôt have anti-Jewish pogroms; and you don‚Äôt have the Crusades or the Spanish Inquisition; you don‚Äôt have witch-burnings. 
What this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that we‚Äôre not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. 
Not only do they deal in a conspiracy-laden world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason ‚Äì and let‚Äôs go ahead and say sanity ‚Äì do not. 
Let‚Äôs face it: Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest enemy is not Satan, but Donald Trump himself. And Wallnau can claim ‚Äúbelievers have an edge‚Äù all they want, but all the belief in the world won‚Äôt overturn reality."	bias

Video: 
Chuck Todd asked Mook if he believed the email story could cost Clinton the election. 
He answered: 
I don‚Äôt think so. Look, as I said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. We‚Äôre seeing record early voting numbers in North Carolina, Florida. Look, I would wager in Nevada turnout is so strong among Democrats there Hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in Nevada. We‚Äôre feeling really good about this record turnout. Over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. Fifty million of those are young people. We‚Äôre just nose to the grindstone, and we‚Äôre going to finish this out. But people should not take anything for granted, and we‚Äôre going to have to work hard to earn this.‚Äù 
Hillary Clinton could put Nevada out of reach for Trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. If Democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story won‚Äôt matter. If Democrats don‚Äôt show up, that is Trump‚Äôs only chance of winning. 
The early voting numbers that Hillary Clinton is running up in Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada are no accident. Clinton and the Democratic Party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. 
Democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but Donal Trump‚Äôs refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. 
The final week before the election could be just as vital to Democrats in swing states as election day. If Hillary Clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. 
The Democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as Mook said, all that is left is for Democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. 
Battleground tracker found that by a small margin Comey‚Äôs letter made Democrats more likely (net +7) to support Clinton. 
In the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 48%-40%, North Carolina (48%-45%), and in Colorado (42%-39%). The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona (44%-42%). 
According to CBS News , ‚ÄúAnd the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap ‚Äì slightly larger now than the last time in these states ‚Äì that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump.‚Äù 
To put it another way, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. 
These are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story isn‚Äôt moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there aren‚Äôt enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. 
Republicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. If the Comey letter is the big October surprise, it isn‚Äôt working on voters.

This is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and well-being. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The following post, written by The Rev. Robert A. Franek, is a part of Politicus Policy Discussion, in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy. 
Even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars, psychic stress, and issue coverage ,it seems all one has to do is put Hillary Clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds. And yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists, so much so that every time Republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire. And sadly this is not going away anytime soon, as Republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as Sarah Jones reported. 
Republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Yes, there will be more toy-throwing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations, more wasteful spending on political witch hunts. ‚Äì Sarah Jones 
Meanwhile, women continue to come forward with painful, heartbreaking stories of Donald Trump‚Äôs sexual harassment and assault. Yet, instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the Republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories, they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner. Woefully, no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women (and men) not to report these crimes, including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial. 
After walking her readers through one incident of Donald Trump‚Äôs public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge , Sarah Jones makes the following observation: 
If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but it‚Äôs not all Trump‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the culture‚Äôs fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
She is right. Donald Trump is despicable. Still, there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects, forced into silence, and placed on trial for their assailant‚Äôs crimes. 
This must change. 
It is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment, assault, exploitation, and humiliation. More it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered, unchallenged, and dismissed. It is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward. 
It is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of Genesis can‚Äôt bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image. 
Supposed Christian values champion and Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Mike Pence is more upset over an article he didn‚Äôt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the Trump campaign than any of the horrifying things Donald Trump has said including bragging about sexual assault. 
These are not Christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold. Failing to call out Donald Trump‚Äôs abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable. Additionally, supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Mike Pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and ‚Äúfamily values.‚Äù 
As a society, we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture. As much as we need changes in our laws (and lawmakers!) at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women, we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story. 
Imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. This is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and well-being.

Four top Democrats sent Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch a letter demanding details on the emails that the FBI is investigating by Monday. In the letter, Sens. Carper, Leahy, Feinstein, and Cardin wrote: 
Senate Democrats aren‚Äôt fooling around. They want answers, and they want them right now. As more details become known, FBI Director Comey‚Äôs motives have come under criticism. Comey was advised by Attorney General Lynch not to send his letter until after the election, but he sent it anyway. 
Comey worried to FBI employees that his letter would be misunderstood, but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all. It is becoming difficult to look at Comey‚Äôs actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations. 
The FBI Director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, but can be used by her opponents for political purposes. 
Democrats are demanding answers, and if James Comey doesn‚Äôt answer their questions by Monday, he will be forced to under oath if the Democratic Party wins a majority of seats in the Senate.

Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
And that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers‚Äô ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. 
This is the second complaint to be filed against FBI Director Comey. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has also filed a complaint against Comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. 
Suspicion around Comey‚Äôs actions has grown as the FBI Director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. Director Comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as Senate Democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the FBI investigation if they win back the Senate majority. 
Unless Trump wins and Republicans take control of Congress, Director Comey is going to have to answer for his decisions.

This exchange between Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace and Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook highlighted why the email scandal isn‚Äôt working for the GOP.

Transcript via Fox News Sunday: WALLACE: The last question I want to ask you is that you‚Äôre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was Hillary Clinton who brought this into the election. 
I want to go back to the e-mail exchange on March 2nd, 2015, when The New York Times broke the story about Hillary Clinton using private e-mails. We‚Äôre going to put it up on the screen. 
Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they get the stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.‚Äù 
Campaign chairman John Podesta, ‚ÄúUnbelievable.‚Äù Tanden, ‚ÄúI guess I know the answer, they wanted to get away with it.‚Äù 
Robby, it was Clinton who delayed and it was Clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. 
MOOK: And it is Secretary Clinton who has said this was a mistake. It is Secretary Clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. And it was Secretary Clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. And what secretary Clinton is doing now is saying, if there‚Äôs new information, get it out on the table. Let‚Äôs get it out. These could be duplicates. 
Again, it‚Äôs been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by Secretary Clinton. We don‚Äôt know anything. And this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when ‚Äì when, again, it‚Äôs been reported by Yahoo! News that ‚Äì that the FBI may have not even seen it. That ‚Äì that ‚Äì that Director Comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesn‚Äôt even know what the information is. That‚Äôs disturbing. And we‚Äôre just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. 
Fox News has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didn‚Äôt release the emails sooner. What Wallace left out was that the release of Clinton‚Äôs emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. 
Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt cause this email scandal. House Republicans misused their Benghazi Select Committee to go on a fishing expedition for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. 
Robbie Mook destroyed Fox News with facts, because unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton hasn‚Äôt worked to keep information hidden from the public. Trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with Russia. Trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. 
Republicans and conservative media are blaming Clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. 
Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the Republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing."	bias

A Trump supporter sporting a ‚ÄúHillary for Prison‚Äù t-shirt chanted ‚ÄúJews S-A‚Äù in support of his candidate during a rally in Arizona on Saturday. 
The target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for Trump‚Äôs rhetoric at every rally. 
The context: While the crowd was chanting ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù one man chanted ‚ÄúJews S-A‚Äù. Words like that can‚Äôt be spun or read into. The intent and meaning were obvious to everyone. 
Watch here on video obtained by The Huffington Post . 
This sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that Donald Trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction. It may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which Trump has shown contempt, but it is not. 
Muslims, Jews, immigrants, labor, taxpayers, Latinos, Hispanics, Mexicans, African-Americans, women, POW‚Äôs, veterans, people with disabilities, Gold Star Families, and the military have felt the sting of Trump‚Äôs words and the disdain in his heart. 
Throughout this campaign season, the vitriol against Hillary Clinton saw no limit. Signs and T-shirts too disgusting to quote in this article. Chants of ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù at the Republican convention and since. Trump promised his base of thugs, lowlifes, and haters he would weaken the first amendment, strengthen the second and establish the alt-right utopia. 
Hillary Clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race. She also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed. Not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar, she was competing for who we are and who we could be. For all the Trump claims that the media is rigged in Clinton‚Äôs favor, it was Trump who got free advertising, who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary ‚Äúnews‚Äù stories of the campaign. 
There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton will keep her promise to fight for us. She has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign. Every time Hillary Clinton called out Donald Trump‚Äôs sexist comments, she was fighting for all women who were attacked, humiliated and sexually abused by men like Trump. Every time Clinton shamed Trump‚Äôs horrific and disgusting comments about the Khan family she was standing up for every Gold Star family. She was also standing up for every Muslim-American. The same is true every time Clinton condemned Trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to alt-right stereotypes about African-Americans, inner-cities, and African-American communities. 
Every time Trump spewed hate in whatever direction, Hillary Clinton defended the target. 
So no, this isn‚Äôt about choosing the lesser of two evils. Like every election, this is about choosing our next president. More importantly, it‚Äôs about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be.

d848d98c0a1204020668ed3a9fdb576946dbb95c	"Here is the full text of Sen. Reid‚Äôs letter to Director Comey: Dear Director Comey: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
The double standard established by your actions is clear. 
In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government ‚Äì a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. 
Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. 
As you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as ‚Äúactivity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.‚Äù 
The clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. 
Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. 
With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong. 
Sincerely, 
Senator Harry Reid 
Reid basically accused Comey of violating the Hatch Act by releasing his letter so close to a presidential election. Even though Harry Reid is retiring, the bad news for Comey is that Reid‚Äôs letter is a clear sign that Senate Democrats aren‚Äôt going to let this matter drop. 
If Democrats take back the Senate, Director Comey should brace himself, because he and his agency‚Äôs methods are going to be under Congressional investigation."	bias

In Senator Harry Reid‚Äôs letter in which he suggests that FBI Director James Comey may have broken the law (the Hatch Law), he also drops the bomb that the FBI and national security experts possess ‚Äúexplosive information‚Äù about ties and coordination between Russia and Donald Trump and his campaign.

Reid points out the ‚Äúdisturbing double standard‚Äù in Comey‚Äôs treatment of sensitive information between the two parties with a ‚Äúclear intent‚Äù to aid one over the other. 
If the FBI and national security experts have information that Donald Trump and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the U.S. election or our foreign policy stances, this is an emergency. 
Which issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just 11 days before an election: Electing someone who is conspiring with Russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about. 
The double standard is not only troubling at this point, but dangerous.

Everyone already suspected Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the Kremlin, but now Reid has confirmed information about coordination between Trump and Russia. 
Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is an October shocker. 
Reid‚Äôs full letter follows: 
Dear Director Comey: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
The double standard established by your actions is clear. 
In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government ‚Äì a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. 
Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. 
As you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as ‚Äúactivity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.‚Äù 
The clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. 
Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. 
With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong. 
Sincerely, 
Senator Harry Reid"	bias

The Trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show. This is why Trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning. Trump still thinks that he can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. Wisconsin might be the most laughable of three delusions because Trump was routed in the Republican primary there, and GOP support from Wisconsin Republicans like Paul Ryan and Scott Walker has been lukewarm at best. 
These are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat. The Comey letter didn‚Äôt move the needle for Trump. It didn‚Äôt give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for Hillary Clinton. 
The Clinton emails didn‚Äôt save Trump, so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line."	bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
As a nation of laws, the American people should, and most likely do, demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the country‚Äôs largest investigative agency. One thing every American who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is. As an occasional print journalist, this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons. The scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney. 
Apparently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten; if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution. However, as it turns out Mr. Comey did get ‚Äúa memo ‚Äù from the Department of Justice in the form of a warning . But because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to House Republicans and not the Department of Justice, he ignored the DOJ counsel to do a solid for the GOP less than two weeks before a presidential election. 
Since Mr. Comey can‚Äôt keep it (investigations) in his pants, or follow long-standing law enforcement and investigative rules, or take heed to Justice Department warnings, it is incumbent on President Barack Obama to summarily fire F.B.I. Director James Comey on the morning of Wednesday, November 9th 2016. Why should President Obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the F.B.I.? So as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election; something FBI director James Comey is apparently incapable of comprehending. 
This incident, just like the one in July when Comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in July, and then publicly testified before Congress to discuss the Bureau‚Äôs ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent; it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason. First, as mentioned above, not only did the Department of Justice warn Mr. Comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all, much less so close to an election, that warning came after the F.B.I. contacted the DOJ about going public with information the Bureau admitted it had not yet even ‚Äú reviewed .‚Äù That was precisely what Comey told his Republican buddies in a letter to Congress. 
In the letter , Comey told congressional Republicans that the F.B.I. really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server, but what he did ‚Äú know ‚Äù for sure was that they ‚Äú appeared ‚Äù to be pertinent; even though his agency, the F.B.I. had not yet examined them. So the real pertinent question is: why did Mr. Comey publicly inform Congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasn‚Äôt attempting to inject some ‚Äò partisan drama ‚Äô into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome? 
It is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from Mr. Comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in July to discuss the agency‚Äôs finding on an investigation before the DOJ weighed in, or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan Republican committee in Congress. And no, it was not to defend the Bureau‚Äôs decision not to bring criminal charges against Clinton; only a brain-dead moronic imbecile or partisan Republican hack would begin to think that the F.B.I., C.I.A., local sheriff, or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation. For dog‚Äôs sake even the 1960‚Äôs fictional sheriff Andy Griffith‚Äôs hapless deputy Barney Fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorney‚Äôs office or Department of Justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law. 
According to Mr. Comey, who was ‚Äú stung by criticism from both Democrats and Republicans ‚Äù as well as former prosecutors and ‚Äú appeared to be on the defensive ;‚Äù ‚Äú he felt obligated to inform [Republicans in] Congress ‚Äù even though the Bureau really didn‚Äôt ‚Äú know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails. ‚Äô‚Äô Likely because he knew they did not come from Hillary Clinton. As an aside, Sarah Jones has a nifty summary of the ‚Äúemail‚Äù caper the F.B.I. Uncovered while investigating ‚Äú serial sexter ‚Äù Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop computer, iPad, and cellphone. And no, Anthony Weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 
It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of pathetic excuse Comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation, it is virtually impossible to believe he didn‚Äôt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting House Republicans. As interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile said, ‚Äú The F.B.I. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters ‚Äì even the faintest appearance of using the agency‚Äôs power to influence our election is deeply troubling .‚Äù Ms. Brazile demanded more information from Comey and didn‚Äôt conceal her concern over Comey interfering with the election. 
Mr. Comey claimed, very conveniently one might add, that as a died-in-the-wool Republican he contributed to John McCain and Willard Romney‚Äôs presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 respectively, that he is not a Republican now. That was his remark back in July when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the Department of Justice, not the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was a suspicious ‚Äú confession ‚Äù in July and it is nearly impossible to believe in late October after he ignored Department of Justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just 11 days before an election and before the Bureau had even reviewed anything. 
Comey cannot possibly remain as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation. If Comey hadn‚Äôt taken heat for his ‚Äòreveal‚Äô in July, and a warning from the Justice Department this week, then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention. But since he was warned, and is not an inept law enforcement official, it is more than reasonable to believe that Comey‚Äôs most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on November 9, 2016. Because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move; something a sap like James Comey might try, but not President Obama."	bias

This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don‚Äôt like. Plain and simple. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G . This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don‚Äôt like. Plain and simple. 
At issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. 
Last summer, the court granted the school board‚Äôs request to put a lower court ruling in the student‚Äôs favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. 
The Virginia school board established a policy mirroring ‚Äúbathroom police‚Äù laws in red states like North Carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. 
In this case, the district court ruled against G.G. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide ‚Äúseparate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex‚Äù provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. 
In January 2015, the Department of Education‚Äôs Office of Civil Rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a ‚Äúschool must treat transgender students‚Äù in a manner consistent ‚Äúwith their gender identity.‚Äù 
Because of that letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of G.G. It relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that courts generally should defer to an agency‚Äôs interpretation of its own regulation. 
In reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. First, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, POC and members of the LGBT community. Second, the right wing is hoping to weaken Federal Agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations."	bias

‚Äî Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) October 30, 2016 
The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton. As Dale told Stelter, ‚ÄúThere is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty.‚Äù Trump, says Dale, ‚Äúis not a normal political liar.‚Äù 
For example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. 
Dale‚Äôs judgment is that ‚Äúthere is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent.‚Äù 
Trump also lies ‚Äúpointlessly,‚Äù argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, 
‚ÄúHe gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether he‚Äôs lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts.‚Äù 
This was Mark Cuban‚Äôs complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. 
In the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trump‚Äôs supporters. You can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
The lie has taken hold ‚Äì one of many ‚Äì many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, 
‚ÄúIf Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education.‚Äù 
Given the GOP‚Äôs history with facts, good luck with that.

c59ef3dfc41908c8aabe6a396b6860f6ae82fef1	"By Rmuse   10:03 am ""The archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. If passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries""   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
For almost all secular humanists, organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation. Throughout recorded history, the Catholic Church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents, but any humans it comes in contact with. That lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st Century and in America like the rest of the Earth the Catholics number one focus has been on controlling women. Apparently, the Catholic Church in Massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population. 
On Friday the Boston Globe reported that the Archdiocese of Boston dropped about a million dollars in a last-ditch effort to exert Church control over Massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use. Other reports reveal that the tax-exempt political spending is meant to help defeat a Massachusetts ballot measure, Question 4 . Question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of Massachusetts. Question 4 contains no references to the Catholic, or any other church, and makes no claim of trying to ‚Äú impact ministries .‚Äù 
A spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the Catholic church‚Äôs political donation to the campaign against Massachusetts‚Äô version of legalized recreational marijuana saying : 
‚Äú It reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. It‚Äôs a recognition that, if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries .‚Äù 
Seriously, that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use tax-free congregants‚Äô donations to interfere in an election ever offered. Nowhere in Massachusetts‚Äô or any state‚Äôs decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned, much less affected by the outcome of an election. Catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis. And despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes, the Church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes, and the USCCB will still attempt to control and dominate all American women. No reefer decriminalization will impact the Catholic ministry, but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession, free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests, and relieve America‚Äôs over-burdened judicial system. 
Now, the Catholics claim that people using cannabis legally, whether they inhale or eat it, will have ‚Äú significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries .‚Äù That is an odd assertion on yet another point; Surely part of ‚ÄúCatholic ministries‚Äù is teaching according to their god‚Äôs word in the Christian bible. It is nearly certain that every Catholic priest on the planet, including those in Massachusetts, are aware of god‚Äôs word in Genesis where in chapter 2, verse 9 the Catholics‚Äô ‚Äú almighty god ‚Äù said: 
‚Äú Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food. ‚Äù And he continues in verses 15-17 , ‚Äú Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. The LORD God commanded the man, saying, ‚ÄúFrom any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die .‚Äù 
Although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10,000 years ago , there is no record of reefer ever being confused with ‚Äú The tree of the knowledge of good and evil; ‚Äù weed is not and will not affect the Catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past two-thousand years the Catholic Church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal. 
In a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with tax-exempt money, an advocate and spokesman for the Yes on Question 4, Jim Borghesani, said : 
‚Äú The archdiocese has come up with a position that, frankly, we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science. What I think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that (marijuana) prohibition has done to people of color, to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because they‚Äôve been arrested .‚Äù 
One wonders if part of the Boston archdiocese‚Äôs ministry entails increasing the number of Americans, mainly Americans of color, sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that ‚Äú god caused to grow ‚Äù and was ‚Äú pleasing to the sight and good to eat .‚Äù Obviously, that is the case and according to a new set of data, keeping marijuana illegal means keeping Americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year. 
Why is the Catholic Church so interested in perpetuating the failed ‚ÄúWar on Drugs in general, and the criminalization of marijuana in particular?‚Äù As noted by Michael Stone over at Patheos, what the Massachusetts Catholics, and Mormons, are actually helping to sustain is ‚Äú in reality a war on poor people and people of color .‚Äù Mr. Stone really nails it when he said that by spending tax-exempt donations on a political agenda to ‚Äú defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana; the Catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed War on Drugs and the New Jim Crow .‚Äù 
The archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy, besides implicit racism. Because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using tax-exempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is ‚Äú morally indefensible .‚Äù Mormons are also busy instructing LDS members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private Mormon lives or their LDS ministry, but they allegedly don‚Äôt condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites; at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned. 
The Massachusetts Catholics may not be violating the law by ‚Äú acting as an anti-marijuana super PAC ,‚Äù but they are using tax-exempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other Americans‚Äô lives; the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of American society. However, if the Church is so flush with money; why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the Church‚Äôs pedophile priests? Or, dog forbid, use that tax-exempt donors‚Äô money to help the people of Massachusetts in need. 
The Catholic Church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents, and that is down to frightened people needing a ‚Äò daddy‚Äô figure in the Church to tell them what is right, what is wrong, and how to stay out of the proverbial Hell; that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity. But for people that are not ‚Äú in the church ‚Äù it is an affront to use donated tax-exempt money to impact (read control) their private lives. The only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like Question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregation‚Äôs hard-earned money. 
This is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and American citizen, except Donald Trump. It is ‚Äú morally obnoxious ‚Äù that the archdiocese is using the congregations‚Äô donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with tax-exempt funds wrung out of hardworking Americans, many of whom use recreational cannabis.

Donald Trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the Middle East that he supported, a war brought to us by a Republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts. Trump is also lying about the facts, which at least brings our country‚Äôs Middle East ordeal full-circle. 
According to Trump, speaking at a rally in New Mexico ‚Äì and you‚Äôve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie ‚Äì ‚ÄúHillary brought disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya and every place that she touches. She empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS by leaving that big vacuum.‚Äù 
Of course, it was Republican President George W. Bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with Iraq, stipulating that America draw down its combat strength. Reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in Iraq, or a negation of ISIS, but a second U.S. invasion on top of the rise of ISIS. 
‚ÄúWe want peace through strength,‚Äù Trump told the crowd. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads.‚Äù 
Well, in fact we DID want to be in that war. We invaded Iraq, not vice versa. 
Trump went on to say, 
‚ÄúDrowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand. We haven‚Äôt had ‚Äì this is medieval times. This is medieval times and then we can‚Äôt do waterboarding, it‚Äôs far too tough! You know, we‚Äôre fighting on a different level! See, we‚Äôre fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious, to be honest with you. Pretty vicious, but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country ‚Äì we‚Äôve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. $6 trillion. And we could‚Äôve rebuilt our country twice.‚Äù 
Never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law; never mind that a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs report said torture doesn‚Äôt work; Trump‚Äôs argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him. 
This is Trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale, and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means. 
He doesn‚Äôt, because he can‚Äôt, prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesn‚Äôt make us barbarians ourselves. He certainly can‚Äôt prove, because that Senate report says otherwise, that torturing people will win the war. 
The claim of $6 million, by the way, is one Trump made last week in Charlotte, NC as well, and PolitiFact ruled it ‚Äúhalf true‚Äù at the time, saying, 
Trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that‚Äôs been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. 
The point here is that this is a war begun not by Obama and certainly not by Hillary Clinton, who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so, while Trump continued to deny he was ever for it, despite the facts to the contrary. 
When Trump says ‚Äúwe have to be pretty vicious‚Äù he is also saying ‚Äúwe have to be pretty dishonest,‚Äù and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as Donald Trump. 
Trump has said he loves war. He has said he likes to be unpredictable. He has asked why we can‚Äôt use nuclear weapons since we have them. This is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands. 
This is a man who, no matter how much he claims otherwise, does not understand how the world works. And he does not understand that by promoting torture, he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the Islamic State, by promising to do precisely what they want him to do."	bias

Newsweek‚Äô s Kurt Eichenwald has struck again, reporting that Donald Trump ‚Äúrefused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.‚Äù 
The whole strategy, he writes at Newsweek in an article he swears was written before Comey‚Äôs announcement, was ‚Äúdeny, impede and delay, while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over.‚Äù 
In 1973, he reveals, ‚Äúthe Republican nominee, his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to African-Americans.‚Äù 
Shortly after the government filed its case in October, Trump attacked: He falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities, but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldn‚Äôt pay their rent.The family‚Äôs attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical. Trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any ‚Äúformal communications‚Äù with him; he contended that he‚Äôd learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning. But Trump‚Äôs sworn statement was a lie. Court records show that the government had filed its complaint at 10 a.m. and phoned him almost immediately afterward. The government later notified the media with a press release. [‚Ä¶] Six months after the original filing, the case was nowhere because the Trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions, known as interrogatories‚Ä¶.Finally, under subpoena, Trump appeared for a short deposition. When asked about the missing documents, he made a shocking admission: The Trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no document-retention program. They had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case. Instead, in order to ‚Äúsave space,‚Äù Trump testified, officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage. 
So Trump can accuse Hillary Clinton of destroying emails ‚Äì and he does, nearly every day ‚Äì but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard. 
‚ÄúWith false affidavits and ‚Äòdeny and delay‚Äù strategies,‚Äù writes Eichenwald, ‚ÄúTrump & his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court.‚Äù 
Donald Trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics, projecting his own guilt onto others. His Foundation in trouble? Point the finger at the Clinton Foundation. Sexual assault allegations? Point the finger at Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
Once again, Kurt Eichenwald has dug into Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable past and revealed the real Donald Trump. It‚Äôs not pretty. And each revelation from Eichenwald and David Fahrenthold shows Trump to be an even worse human being than the last. 
It is no wonder his deplorables love him so much.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump announced the complaint in a statement: 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint against Representative Jason Chaffetz on Monday morning with the Office of Congressional Ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by FBI Director James Comey. 
‚ÄúRepresentative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton‚Äôs emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions,‚Äù said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. 
Director Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. 
The Comey letter couldn‚Äôt have gone much worse for Republicans. What the GOP originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a Republican scandal that Democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the Senate majority . 
Thanks to Chaffetz, House Republicans have already their credibility for future Clinton investigations, a s the Utah Republican‚Äôs spin of Comey‚Äôs letter was debunked in a matter of hours. 
It‚Äôs all gone wrong in short order for Republicans. Comey and Chaffetz are facing complaints, and Hillary Clinton remains on course to be elected the next President Of The United States."	bias

CNN has obtained brand new audio of North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr joking about gun owners putting a ‚Äúbullseye‚Äù on Hillary Clinton. 
The despicable comments come as Burr faces a close Senate race against Democratic opponent Deborah Ross. Both candidates are within a point of each other, according to RealClearPolitics. 
More of the CNN report : 
The North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection, quipped that as he walked into a gun shop ‚Äúnothing made me feel better‚Äù than seeing a magazine about rifles ‚Äúwith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI was a little bit shocked at that ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt have a bullseye on it,‚Äù he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. ‚ÄúBut on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there‚Äôs an army of support out there right now for our candidates.‚Äù 
This type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to Republican leaders in 2016. As the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the Republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. 
At one point this year, Donald Trump suggested that ‚ÄúSecond Amendment people‚Äù should take up arms against Clinton if she nominates a Supreme Court justices they don‚Äôt like. He also said that he‚Äôd like to ‚Äúsee what happens‚Äù if the Democratic nominee‚Äôs bodyguards were disarmed. 
As CNN notes, Trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language ‚Äì or anything he‚Äôs ever said or done ‚Äì but Burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. 
‚ÄúThe comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,‚Äù the Republican senator said, according to CNN. 
This type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether it‚Äôs being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward Hillary Clinton from Trump supporters. 
Whether it‚Äôs Trump or Burr, voters should remember their irresponsible language when they go to vote in just one week."	bias

A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. 
CNBC reported : FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI‚Äôs name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former FBI official tells CNBC. 
‚Ä¶. 
According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: ‚ÄúA foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election.‚Äù Comey‚Äôs position, this official said, was ‚Äúif it is said, it shouldn‚Äôt come from the FBI, which as you‚Äôll recall it did not.‚Äù 
Director Comey didn‚Äôt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. 
With each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Comey may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. 
When the information was bad for Donald Trump, Comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. 
It is becoming clear that Comey has abused his power and must be removed as FBI Director immediately."	bias
a07153627bbe6478fdff881737915fe941efd506	"The Washington Post reported: Donald Trump‚Äôs hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. 
But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaign‚Äôs latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio‚Äôs firm says it is still owed for polling. 
Trump‚Äôs decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trump‚Äôs history of not paying for services performed; it won‚Äôt be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isn‚Äôt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. 
Anybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald Trump‚Äôs version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket.

While the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a non-story ‚Äì FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs vague letter regarding more emails related to Hillary Clinton ‚Äì news about Donald Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia continues to gain steam. 
Not only did NBC just report that the FBI is now in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump‚Äôs ex-campaign manager‚Äôs connection to Russia, but Slate also reported on Monday that a Trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a Russian bank. 
Slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the Russian cyber attack of the DNC, they stumbled onto something unexpectedly. 
The report: 
In late July, one of these scientists‚Äîwho asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data‚Äîfound what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves‚Äô attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance‚Äîa surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. ‚ÄúI have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,‚Äù he wrote in his notes. He couldn‚Äôt quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue. 
More data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the Trump server‚Äôs DNS activity. As he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. Six of them began scrutinizing them for clues. 
The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn‚Äôt the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation‚Äîconversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn‚Äôt an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank. 
This news doesn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, all while taking pro-Russia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a Kremlin wishlist. 
The Clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by Clinton Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan: 
This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia. It certainly seems the Trump Organization felt it had something to hide, given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists. 
This line of communication may help explain Trump‚Äôs bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many pro-Kremlin positions throughout this campaign. It raises even more troubling questions in light of Russia‚Äôs masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia‚Äôs meddling in our elections. 
Trump‚Äôs pro-Russia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence. The more information that comes out, the clearer it is that the Republican nominee has connections to Russia that he is hiding from voters. 
With just a week until Election Day, this is the explosive story the media should be focusing on. It‚Äôs critical that the American people know what kind of financial ties a potential president has with an American adversary, especially when that adversary is Russia."	bias

While Donald Trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades, the New York Times reported on Monday that Trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share. 
According to the Times, the Republican nominee used a ‚Äútax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.‚Äù 
The report: 
Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump‚Äôs tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. ‚ÄúWhatever loophole existed was not ‚Äòexploited‚Äô here, but stretched beyond any recognition,‚Äù said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. 
Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people‚Äôs money ‚Äî in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City. 
The reason that Trump bent over backward ‚Äì and potentially broke laws ‚Äì to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to ‚Äústave off financial ruin.‚Äù 
This is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù business background. 
Yet, he calls himself the ‚Äúking of debt.‚Äù His businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. He has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. He lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. Reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to Russia. 
All of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. 
Even as all of this information is out there, American voters still know very little about Donald Trump‚Äôs finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. 
And consider this: What Trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. If it weren‚Äôt, he would have already released them. 
The latest New York Times story is just the latest installment of Trump‚Äôs shady business background. The media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the country‚Äôs pocketbook."	bias

Republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù. 
The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC‚Äôs poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. 
The order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendant‚Äôs (RNC‚Äôs) efforts with the Trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, ‚Äúas indicated by Kellyanne Conway‚Äù. 
Affidavits are also demanded from several Republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù monitoring and poll monitoring, such as RNC member Rob Gleason‚Äôs efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and RNC member Ronna Romney McDaniel‚Äôs efforts in Michigan to prepare a ‚Äúmassive, statewide anti-voter fraud effort‚Äù. 
The RNC must also answer for Governor Mike Pence‚Äôs comments that the Trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ‚Äúballot integrity‚Äù. 
This is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. 
Rick Hasen at Election Law Blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, ‚ÄúPretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on November 4.‚Äù 
However, ‚ÄúThe judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the DNC given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes.‚Äù 
The DNC filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Donald Trump‚Äôs claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own (often in ‚Äúurban‚Äù areas) to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isn‚Äôt likely to stand for it. 
So now discovery has been court-ordered, which is just more bad news for Republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the White House. 
It‚Äôs exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. Everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. Don‚Äôt let anyone dissuade you from voting.

We looked yesterday at Kurt Eichenwald‚Äôs revelation that Donald Trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. That is hardly Trump‚Äôs only misdeed, but how many people realize that Donald Trump, at this moment, has 75 ‚Äì SEVENTY-FIVE ‚Äì legal issues hanging over his head. 
He‚Äôs lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers ‚Äì and with much less excuse, the mainstream media ‚Äì thoroughly distracted by the Clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. 
USA TODAY reported at the end of October that ‚ÄúJust two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY.‚Äù 
It will surprise no one, because Trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that ‚ÄúOne Trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day.‚Äù 
If one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that Trump does not pay his bills. Earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a Florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been ‚Äúpaid enough,‚Äù even though it wasn‚Äôt the agreed-upon amount. Trump got nailed by the court for $300K in attorney‚Äôs fees in that case. 
Just a few examples from USA TODAY‚Äôs investigation: 
Trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses: angry members at his Jupiter, Fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. There‚Äôs a fraud case brought by Trump University students who say the mogul‚Äôs company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. Trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. A disgruntled GOP political consultant sued for $4 million saying Trump defamed her. Another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. 
As pointed out by USA TODAY‚Äôs Nick Penzenstadler and John Kelly, these lawsuits will dog Trump into the White House, should he win. He will have no immunity because he is president. And America ‚Äì and the world ‚Äì will be treated to the spectacle of the President of the United States having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. 
There are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving Trump University. As USA TODAY notes, ‚Äúas recently as last spring‚Ä¶New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country.‚Äù 
And those 75 cases will likely grow. 
Trump has promised, after all, to sue The New York Times and each of the women ‚Äì NYMag maintains an exhaustive list ‚Äì who have accused him of sexual assault. 
USA Today says it spent six months researching court records. ‚ÄúThe exclusive analysis,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúfound an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. The cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the White House.‚Äù 
Donald Trump claims Clinton is tainted. He claims Clinton‚Äôs emails are bigger than Watergate. The other day tweeted , ‚ÄúWe must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp.‚Äù 
This comes from the man who would turn the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue into a morality No-Go Zone. 
All the facts ‚Äì including the new disclosures about Trump‚Äôs ties to a Russian server and his potentially illegal ploy to avoid paying taxes ‚Äì make it clear that if Trump the deadbeat liar drains the swamp, he will be the first one down the drain."	bias
44225bfcf0b8acdae9a647db9f88af2909175e1e	"By Rmuse   10:00 am The voter suppression tactic is right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in North Carolina.‚Äù   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Some Americans are likely aware of the psychological term ‚Äúprojecting‚Äù that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else; as an ‚Äòunconscious‚Äô form of transferring guilt for one‚Äôs own actions. As soon as the Republican primaries concluded, Donald Trump projected Republicans‚Äô guilt for election rigging, either through vote obstruction or suppression, onto Democrats and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of Barack Obama in 2008, and they have only ramped up their ‚Äò election rigging‚Äô activities over the past eight years; and yet Trump accuses Democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath. 
Yesterday, the North Carolina conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against North Carolina Republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the ‚Äú coordinated effort to suppress the Black vote in the state .‚Äù What the NAACP rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was ‚Äú right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in the state. ‚Äù 
The election rigging amounts to three counties in North Carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of, mostly African American, Democratic residents a week before the presidential election. The lawsuit charged election officials in Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland counties of denying primarily African American voters‚Äô eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were ‚Äú bounced back as undeliverable. ‚Äù 
Most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging, such as James Edward Arthur Sr. had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots. Many of the purged voters lived at their ‚Äú original registration address ‚Äù and were victims of a ‚Äú simple postal service error. ‚Äù 
Mr. Arthur is an African American who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue. Arthur testified that he, like thousands of other African American Democratic voters, never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied, or that if he didn‚Äôt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy. Mr. Arthur said, 
‚Äú If I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted .‚Äù 
It is what any sane human being would consider ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù simply because the tri-county ploy targeted primarily African Americans who typically vote for Democrats. It is also something North Carolina Republicans have been guilty of for the past six years. 
According to the NAACP lawsuit, North Carolina Republicans are in violation of the National Voter Registration Act which ‚Äú bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election .‚Äù Republican election officials State officials defended their ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù and said they were justified in ‚Äú purging tens-of-thousands ‚Äù of mainly African American Democratic voters‚Äô eligibility, the definition of systemic, on an individual basis. 
However, the NAACP also accused Republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly African American voters‚Äô eligibility who did not receive the mailing. One Republican who ran for a local office last year, Shane Hubers, challenged the registration of voters,‚Ääthe majority who are them Democrats, ‚Ääin Beaufort County. 
In one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit, Cumberland County, one ‚Äú individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3,951 mostly Democratic voters .‚Äù In Moore County, the secretary of the local Republican Party, N. Carol Wheeldon, challenged approximately 400 mainly African American registered voters; likely because they do not vote for Republicans. 
The lead attorney for the NAACP‚Äôs lawsuit, Penda Hair, said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted Republican ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù conspiracy; 
‚Äú We know that in two of the counties, the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local Republican Party. We also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties .‚Äù Ms. Hair also noted that, ‚Äú in Moore County the return address of a right-wing group called the Voter Integrity Project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters. This is a very pernicious treatment of voters ,‚Äù she said. It is also a deliberate act of ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù by Republicans. 
The president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Dr. William Barber said, 
‚Äú We are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in North Carolina that we‚Äôve seen since the days of Jim Crow. The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters. These attempts are a direct affront to our Constitution .‚Äù 
The NAACP lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this ‚Äúelection rigging ‚Äù process back on the rolls immediately. The organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters, and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on Election Day. They have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case. 
It might be the case that the NAACP‚Äôs request for a hearing may be granted; especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that North Carolina Republicans violated the National Voter Registration Act in yet another manner; failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a DMV office over the past few years. 
Last Thursday U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ordered North Carolina Republicans to permit those tens-of-thousands of voters to cast provisional ballots. It is highly doubtful that North Carolina Republicans will obey the Federal Judge‚Äôs orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their ‚Äúelection rigging‚Äù actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the Republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters. 
Republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the American people first elected Barack Obama as President, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with Republicans to suppress, or obstruct, the voting rights of primarily people of color because they don‚Äôt support Republicans. To be perfectly clear, it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression, obstruction, or disenfranchisement; it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections. And it is only Republicans and the Koch brothers‚Äô outfit the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), who are behind each and every attempt in Republican-controlled states to kill democracy by doing what the Republican Party standard bearer Donald Trump is guilty of projecting; rig elections."	bias
b6ca5fe5b5b814eda41b9d379b2f96f4ed1917f1	"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   9:04 am The KKK newspaper features the front page full page story ""Make America Great Again"" with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump   
Rachel Maddow traces the history of the post-Civil War ‚ÄúEnforcement Acts‚Äù signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, including the Ku Klux Klan Act , or The Enforcement Act of 1871 (17 Stat. 13), which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters. 
To show that the Klan Act is not ‚Äúvestigial‚Äù but very much relevant in this election, Maddow points to the citation of this law by the Democrat Party in a ‚Äúwhole raft of lawsuits‚Äù in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio alleging voter intimidation. 
Maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway, the significance of the Klan Act is that it prohibits ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù to ‚Äúprevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a member of Congress of the United States.‚Äù 
As an example of the role the KKK plays in Trump‚Äôs campaign, Maddow produced the KKK‚Äôs newspaper of today, which bills itself as ‚ÄúThe Political Voice of White Christian America,‚Äù which, you might note, is identical with Fox News demographic. This paper, she says, ‚Äúhas been turning up on front lawns in the great state of Georgia.‚Äù 
Watch courtesy of MSNBC (discussion begins at 9:15 mark): 
Tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development. This is the newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan today. It‚Äôs The Crusader, the political voice of white Christian America. The premier voice of white resistance. They‚Äôve got ‚Äî you see the white power symbol there in the upper right-hand corner? They‚Äôve got a whole media operation going on apparently. Watch white pride TV, listen to KKK radio 24 hours a day. This newsletter is about 12 pages long, features articles on ‚Äúthe threat of nonwhite immigration,‚Äù a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people. There‚Äôs an article by the founder of the America First Party which is all about the terrorist Jews. He brags in his byline that he‚Äôs the man who David Duke credits for awakening him to the threat of Jewish supremacism. It‚Äôs exactly what you would think from the Ku Klux Klan newspaper. If you knew there was a Ku Klux Klan newspaper these days. But the front page full page story is ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump. It‚Äôs one of several articles in the paper about Trump, including this in-set article about how Trump‚Äôs candidacy is ‚Äúmoving the dialogue forward.‚Äù [‚Ä¶] Those are a couple of the many, many robocalls that were made during the Republican primary campaign on behalf of Donald Trump‚Äôs candidacy, calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the American National Super PAC. The Trump campaign doesn‚Äôt appear to have anything to do with these calls. They reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a Trump donor. It was further embarrassing to the Trump campaign when this guy, this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls, he was initially picked to be a Trump delegate to the Republican Convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a ‚ÄúWhite homeland‚Äù and that, of necessity, the United States must be this White homeland. As Maddow has pointed out in the past, and by their own admission, their ‚Äúeugenics insanity‚Äù is now out in the open because of Donald Trump. 
Don‚Äôt believe Maddow? Demographics Pro looked at ‚Äú10,000 Donald Trump Twitter supporters [and] found that more than one third follow white nationalist Twitter accounts.‚Äù 
The fact is, Trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it, brought it into his own ‚Äúmovement,‚Äù which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white working-class Americans, whatever the mainstream media tells you. 
The Trump campaign is a maelstrom of hate, and the KKK is right at the heart of it."	bias
52fc8f910ed2a40681c9e4574a9751e45ef8c94c	"In a major omen of potential election disaster for Republicans, Donald Trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of Gallup‚Äôs presidential leadership poll. 
Gallup released their presidential leadership survey, and the results were historically bad for Donald Trump: 
Voters rate Trump worse than any other presidential candidate in Gallup‚Äôs records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. Previous readings were taken in late October in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. In those years, between 52% and 61% of registered voters said the two major-party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities ‚Äî a sharp contrast to Trump‚Äôs current 32%. Clinton‚Äôs rating of 51% is one percentage point below the previous low score. 
Clinton‚Äôs score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. Trump‚Äôs score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. 
Voters aren‚Äôt going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. The popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nation‚Äôs political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the Democratic candidate. 
Donald Trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate. He doesn‚Äôt look, act, or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the Oval Office and lead the United States of America. 
The last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal, but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest haven‚Äôt changed. Democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage, while Donald Trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot. 
Republicans look to be heading for a major ballot box disaster because voters do not believe that Donald Trump is fit to be president."	bias

A ‚Äúveteran‚Äù spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was ‚Äúshock and horror.‚Äù 
The report alleges that Trump and his ‚Äúinner circle‚Äù have accepted a regular ‚Äúflow of intelligence from the Kremlin and that Russian intelligence claims to have ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump on his visits and could ‚Äúblackmail him‚Äù. 
David Corn at Mother Jones reported: 
Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer‚Äôs conversations with Russian sources, noted, ‚ÄúRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.‚Äù It maintained that Trump ‚Äúand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.‚Äù It claimed that Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚Äù It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ‚Äúbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.‚Äù 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was ‚Äúshock and horror.‚Äù The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos‚Äîsome of which referred to members of Trump‚Äôs inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,‚Äù he says. 
In August, Corn reports, the FBI asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he ‚Äúcontinued to share information with the FBI‚Äù which he says made it clear there was a ‚Äúpretty substantial inquiry going on.‚Äù 
If this report is accurate, the spy‚Äôs information confirms what Senator Harry Reid says intelligence experts and FBI Director James Comey already shared with him regarding ‚Äúexplosive information‚Äù regarding ties and coordination between Donald Trump and Russia. 
This report also rings true given report about the Trump server repeatedly being connected to Russia, including Trump‚Äôs server possibly communicating with a Russian bank. 
It also makes sense given the many ties to Russia within Trump‚Äôs own campaign and indeed Trump‚Äôs own rhetoric regarding NATO and Russia. Trump changed the Republican Party platform‚Äôs pro-Ukraine proposals and talked about weakening NATO, both of which mirrored Putin‚Äôs wish list. NBC reported Monday evening that the FBI is in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump‚Äôs ex-campaign manager‚Äôs connection to Russia. 
Donald Trump has already been busted for reading Russian propaganda at his rallies, as Newsweek‚Äôs Kurt Eichenwald uncovered an instance of Trump reading propaganda directly from Putin at a rally in Pennsylvania. 
Eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the Russians have been hacking into American emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, ‚ÄúThe Russians have been obtaining American emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of them‚Äîfalsifying them‚Äîin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. The big question, of course, is why are the Russians working so hard to damage Clinton and, in the process, aid Donald Trump?‚Äù 
The answer to why Putin is trying so hard to defeat Clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is no pushover. According to former U.S. officials, Putin sees Clinton as a ‚Äúforceful proponent of ‚Äòregime change‚Äô policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival.‚Äù 
Trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the Kremlin. He‚Äôs been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. It‚Äôs also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him ‚Äì see the Billy Bush bus tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Trump is easy bait. 
The fact that the FBI Director felt compelled to announce something about Hillary‚Äôs emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aide‚Äôs emails and even then he wasn‚Äôt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about Donald Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia under wraps is very disturbing. 
This isn‚Äôt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the FBI follows about ongoing investigations. This is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. But the fact that they come from different sources and that Trump willingly staffed his own campaign with Russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak ‚Äî these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions."	bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. 
But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as ‚Äúpartisan‚Äù. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more ‚Äúon the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,‚Äù officials ‚Äúfamiliar with the deliberations‚Äù told the Washington Post. 
These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. 
There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agency‚Äôs investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clinton‚Äôs emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. 
Comey‚Äôs decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already ‚Äúcompromised.‚Äù 
Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. 
The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
Not sure I‚Äôm buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn‚Äôt have said anything at all, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that his motives were nefarious. 
There might well be good reason for this ‚Äì after all, this is the FBI and they can‚Äôt tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt doing his job properly. 
But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations he‚Äôs giving for these decisions don‚Äôt make sense and are contradictory."	bias

This is how the conversation went, per CBS News‚Äô Sopan Deb , as always highlighting the important bits:

‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016

The more things change, the more they stay the same. The House Freedom Caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical Republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting Paul Ryan and demanding more ransom from GOP leadership. 
Politico reported , ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing questions preoccupying Washington is what the group will do about Paul Ryan.

The Freedom Caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members, some at the expense of GOP leadership‚Äôs authority.‚Äù 
There have been early rumblings that Speaker Ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with Hillary Clinton if she wins the election. One of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right Republicans to cause trouble. 
If Ryan‚Äôs Republican majority shrinks, he will be an even bigger hostage to the far-right wing of his caucus. The dysfunctional dynamic in the House is going to continue even if Hillary Clinton wins the election. Ryan has run into the same hurdles that John Boehner faced. House Republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything. 
The fact that the Freedom Caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change. If Paul Ryan doesn‚Äôt cave to their demands, they will force Ryan out of the Speaker position.

Republicans are so far removed from reality that Sean Hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. 
CNN reported, ‚ÄúThe progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. In this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called ‚ÄúYour News Wire,‚Äù which publishes a mix of true, slanted and made-up news.

Some right-wing websites spread the story, which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop. The fake news eventually reached The Gateway Pundit, and to Sean Hannity‚Äôs radio show. 
After spreading the fake news to millions of listeners, Hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right, ‚ÄúBottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way, I was dealing with more important issues like HRC crimes and lies and how CNN has been colluding with the Clinton campaign and CHEATING Bernie Sanders.‚Äù 
Hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù and how the election is being stolen from Donald Trump. 
How Hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the right-wing media echo chamber works. Nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the Republican Party belief has replaced fact.

Days ago, Snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the FBI‚Äôs bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to Clinton. 
Claim: After FBI Director Jim Comey announced that he was reviewing e-mails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton, several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes. mixture 
WHAT‚ÄôS TRUE: Some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day. 
WHAT‚ÄôS FALSE: No states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for Hillary Clinton to change their votes. 
And to make this even better, that false information was based on a Fox News report that wasn‚Äôt selling the false story about Clinton, but still got some of the information wrong. This is why the Right can‚Äôt have nice things. The Left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular, because epistemic closure leads to losing. 
Trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping, exhaustive list of lawsuits, bragging about sexual assault, dissing minorities and a Gold Star family, and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaign‚Äôs ties to Russia. 
Only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a Clinton aide‚Äôs emails when they don‚Äôt even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet.

I was in a rollover accident a little over six months ago where my arm was ripped off at the elbow, had to have six vertebrae in my neck fused, had a couple of skin grafts and a wound on the top of my head that still hasn‚Äôt closed all the way up and healed. I went to DSHS to see about help while i recovered and filled out all the applications and medical records releases. I got denied on everything. I will say that they took over healthcare after insurance limits were reached, which didn‚Äôt take long the 15 minute helicopter ride was over $29,000 alone. I have never used any public service before, I‚Äôm a veteran and I have always had a job since I was 13 years old. I understand helping those immigrants that need it but shouldn‚Äôt their be some kind of vetting oversight? Especially when you make your own citizens jump through all kinds of hoops only to tell them no. r.terbeek

For years the Marxist Democrats have openly committed voter fraud knowing that the cowardly Republicans would do absolutely nothing to stop it out of fear of being called racists.

Recorded audio of a series of phone conversations between former President Bill Clinton and his mistress, Gennifer Flowers, have recently surfaced.
In one of the recordings, from 1991, Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is heard advising Flowers to deny any claims that he had aided her in getting a state job.

At the time of the recording, the media had been asking many questions about Clinton‚Äôs affair with Flowers and she was worried that the barrage of questions could inevitably lead to inquires into how she landed her job as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
 
A complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that Flowers‚Äô relationship with Clinton kept her from getting the job when, the woman claimed, she was more qualified.
In the audio, Clinton is heard coaching Flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise.
The sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in 1992. This came just one day after Clinton had appeared on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary ‚Äî the current Democratic presidential nominee ‚Äî blatantly denying any romantic relationship with Flowers.
However, in his deposition for a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, Clinton would eventually admit to having a sexual interaction with Flowers in 1998.

In the past year, Americans have seen police officers ambushed and assassinated, and they have watched as the thin line protecting citizens from criminals has been reviled by groups such as Black Lives Matter.
And now America is taking its stand.
A new Gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years.
 
Related Stories Video: Suspect Beats Female Officer Who Didn‚Äôt Use Weapon Out Of Fear Of Backlash Police Officer Issues A Moving Response To Kaepernick‚Äôs Protest NBA Anthem Singer Drops To Knee During Final Line To Protest Racial Inequality The poll, taken in early October, found that 76 percent of Americans have ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù of respect for police and another 17 percent say they have ‚Äúsome‚Äù respect.
‚ÄúObviously, this violent rhetoric we have seen from BLM has backfired ,‚Äù wrote Andrew Mark Miller on Young Conservatives.
‚ÄúPeople respect the cops more than ever and they clearly see what a difficult job they have,‚Äù he added.
 
Miller said the Black Lives Matter movement denies its true purpose.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt give me this nonsense about how BLM isn‚Äôt anti-police,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn fact, many BLM supporters have been out there saying we should eliminate the police force entirely .‚Äù
Miller said the bottom line is clear.
‚ÄúThis poll is a repudiation of the tactics the left has used to demonize law enforcement. No getting around it,‚Äù he wrote.

Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.
The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.
‚ÄúThe increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites,‚Äù Gallup reported in analyzing its results.
‚ÄúThe sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive ‚Äî both politically and for their lives while they are on duty ‚Äî amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings,‚Äù it added.
Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer,‚Äù it wrote.

Ezekiel Emanuel laughed on Wednesday as the hosts of MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe joked about his brainchild, Obamacare, which on Tuesday Emanuel noted was going to cause severe fiscal pain for at least a million Americans.
On Wednesday‚Äôs show, Mika Brzezinski noted that Emanuel, a former adviser to President Barack Obama is ‚Äúoften called one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that working for you right now, Zeke?‚Äù chimed in host Joe Scarborough.

A day before, there were not many smiles when Emanual appeared on CNN and told Jake Tapper the extent of Obamacare‚Äôs fiscal effects.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a million people for whom this is going to be severe or uncomfortable,‚Äù he said.
Earlier this week, the Obama administration announced that the average premium costs will rise 25 percent next year. However, some states were far higher. A popular ‚Äú silver‚Äù healthcare plan is scheduled to increase 116 percent in Arizona; 40 percent in North Carolina; and 53 percent in Pennsylvania.
Emanuel said the problem of rising premiums some Americans will have trouble affording is just part of the way Obamacare evolved.

‚ÄúThese price increases that we‚Äôre seeing this year are a one-time increase relative to the fact that insurance companies didn‚Äôt know who was going to come in, under-priced their premiums in the first few years, and are readjusting them based on who‚Äôs in the marketplace,‚Äù said Emanuel, suggesting that tweaking the system will fix the problem.

A CBS News report from McAllen, Texas , noted that large numbers of illegal immigrants have crossed the border from Mexico and turned themselves in. They are released by the Border Patrol after being given ankle monitors while they file paperwork to be granted asylum so they can remain in the U.S.
Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera said the rush is triggered by politics.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president.
Coming off of campaign events in Florida Tuesday and before he jetted off to North Carolina to resume his quest for the White House, Trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., built in the city‚Äôs historic Old Post Office building.
‚ÄúUnder budget and ahead of schedule. So important. We don‚Äôt hear those words so often, but you will,‚Äù said Trump , linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president. ‚ÄúToday is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.‚Äù

The fact that Trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction.

Republican strategist Steve Schmidt , who helped Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his 2008 White House race, was among those who said Trump‚Äôs priorities were skewed.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other GOP candidate has before.
He has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the Republican Party.
Zac Moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.
 
Related Stories Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‚ÄòSexual Predator‚Äô Accusations Donald Trump‚Äôs Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio ‚ÄúThe people who donate are your core believers,‚Äù said Moffatt, who was digital director for Mitt Romney‚Äôs 2012 campaign.
Romney and Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.
However, Trump‚Äôs campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as $200 or less.
 
In this category, Trump has raised more than $78.6 million thus far, based on data from the Federal Election Commission.
In comparison, McCain raised $65.5 million and Romney raised $44.8 million by this point in their election races.
While McCain and Romney had significant income contributions from other sources, Trump‚Äôs small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
According to OpenSecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below $200 mark the campaigns aren‚Äôt legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds $200 the campaign must give the donor‚Äôs name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.

The two also discussed certain polls showing Trump trailing behind Clinton with only two weeks to go until Election Day.
While Kelly asserted that many polls have Clinton ahead in the race, Gingrich reminded her that early voting statistics show Republicans outvoting Democrats in Florida and Pennsylvania.

There‚Äôs a reason David Brock, founder of the liberal group Media Matters for America, chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super PACs and nonprofits.
Professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts. Brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the Bonner Group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.
David Brock is laundering money 
 
Related Stories Consumers Need Protection From New Consumer Protection Bureau Rule Here‚Äôs What The Markets Are Telling Us‚Ä¶ Exposed: Profiteers Of Governing ‚Äì And These Are The Ones Who Got Caught! Brock has seven nonprofits, three super PACs, one 527 committee, one LLC, one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in Washington .
Uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.
The Bonner Group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. Every time money gets passed around, Bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.
 
Follow the money 
Nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.
But they aren‚Äôt required to disclose who gives them cash grants.
This weak system of one-way verification is being abused by Brock. He‚Äôs been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the Bonner Group‚Äôs 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency In 2014, Media Matters for America raised more than $10 million.
The Bonner Group was credited for raising these funds. Media Matters paid it a $1.1 million commission.

That same year, Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock‚Äôs Franklin Education Forum , an organization that shares office space with Media Matters.

In 2014, the Franklin Education Forum reported $994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from Media Matters.
Surprisingly, though, the Franklin Education Forum gave full credit to Bonner for raising that money. It paid the fundraiser a $124,250 commission in 2014.

Notice what happened? 
Brock‚Äôs Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock‚Äôs Franklin Education Forum. Brock‚Äôs Franklin Education Forum credited the Bonner Group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. Brock paid the Bonner Group a $124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant ‚Ä¶ from himself! It doesn‚Äôt stop there 
After the Franklin Education Forum retained $869,750, it sent a $816,224 cash grant to Brock‚Äôs Franklin Forum . 

Note: The Franklin Education Forum is a 501(c)3, and The Franklin Forum is a 501(c)4. They are not the same company. 
The Franklin Forum 501(c)4 paid Bonner a commission in 2013 , so it‚Äôs safe to assume the fundraiser received a $102,028 commission in 2014. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs hard to tell for sure. It still hasn‚Äôt filed its taxes for 2014!
Let‚Äôs recap 
Say, for example, you donate $1,062,857 to Media Matters for America. This is how David Brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014:
Media Matters would receive your $1,062,857 donation. The Bonner Group would earn a $132,857 commission. Media Matters would retain $930,000. Next, Media Matters would give what‚Äôs left of your entire donation , $930,000, to the Franklin Education Forum. The Bonner Group would ‚Äúearn‚Äù a $116,250 commission. The Franklin Education Forum would retain $813,750. The Franklin Education Forum would then forward the remaining $813,750 to The Franklin Forum. The Bonner Group would ‚Äúearn‚Äù a $101,718 commission. The Franklin Forum would retain $712,031. In the end, Brock‚Äôs solicitor would have pocketed $350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. That‚Äôs a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.
As bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what Brock did in 2014.
How can we be sure this is intentional? 
Brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. How could he not know what‚Äôs going on?
He‚Äôs a hands-on chairman. According to their tax returns, Brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations:
Media Matters: 31.50 hours per week Franklin Education Forum: three hours per week The Franklin Forum: one hour per week Furthermore, The New York Times reports that Brock shares a summer rental in the Hamptons with Mary Pat Bonner, the president of the Bonner Group.
Brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. These transfers are intentional. He vacations with his solicitor. Case closed.
Still not convinced? 
Brock didn‚Äôt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. They all share the same number.

What if ‚Ä¶? 
We even located the Bonner Group‚Äôs solicitation agreement with Media Matters on Florida‚Äôs Gift Givers‚Äô Guide . Clarification on the commission can be found on page 2:

In English: Contractually, Brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. In spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.
Note: Yes, we are making the assumption that all of Brock‚Äôs organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the Bonner Group. Given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel it‚Äôs safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. 
This barely scratches the surface 
Utilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the Federal Election Commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in Brock‚Äôs office:

Summary 
This is all from just one year! No further commentary required.
We understand this may be hard to believe. We first came across this in July, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.
All of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. Check for yourself ‚Äî we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in Brock‚Äôs office. These data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. 
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
We‚Äôve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. But there aren‚Äôt any loopholes. David Brock has something to hide. Just last month, The Daily Caller reported the following:
‚ÄúBrock‚Äôs former long-time live-in boyfriend William Grey (whom Brock has thanked in several of his books) threatened to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. What did Brock do? He paid Grey $850,000 to keep quiet. Brock reportedly had to sell his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, to come up with the money. This certainly seems to indicate that Brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.‚Äù
Adding to this, Fox News reported the following:
‚ÄúGrey accused Brock of ‚Äòfinancial malfeasance‚Äô and threatened to undermine Brock‚Äôs fundraising efforts.
‚Äú‚ÄòNext step is I contact all your donors and the IRS,‚Äô Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. ‚ÄòThis is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'‚Äù
We believe that the information presented in this article is what has Brock so terrified. We feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that David Brock is laundering money through his Media Matters conglomerate.

In 2002, Elizabeth Smart was abducted during the night at knifepoint from her bedroom at only 14-years-old.
Her kidnapping quickly garnered national media attention. Her media savvy parents worked overtime to keep her story in the news throughout the ordeal.
During her 9 months in captivity she was raped repeatedly, often as many as 3-4 times per day. Each day was a mental and physical war for her to survive at the hands of her kidnapper and rapist, Brian David Mitchell.

Justice wasn‚Äôt finally served until 2011 when Mitchell received two life-terms in a federal prison.
Smart, now 28 years old, is married and a mother with a family of her own. Her daughter, Chloe is now 20 months old.

‚ÄúWhen I go back to my own situation, I almost think it was worse for my parents than for me because I knew that I was alive, but they didn‚Äôt know,‚Äù she told People magazine.
‚ÄúI always knew how much they loved me, but until I had my own daughter I didn‚Äôt realize how all-consuming that is. The worst thing in the world would be if something happened to my little girl,‚Äù she continued.

After the release of a WikiLeaks email chain from March 2015 on Tuesday in which a top Clinton aide admitted President Barack Obama falsely claimed he did not know about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server use while she was secretary of state, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.
‚ÄúWhat the president said was an entirely factual response,‚Äù Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.
Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the president‚Äôs actions as mere conspiracies.

He continued, ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.‚Äù
Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clinton‚Äôs private email server ‚Äúthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.‚Äù
 
Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clinton‚Äôs email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
He reiterated that position on Tuesday.
‚ÄúThe president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them,‚Äù Earnest said.
‚ÄúOf course the president had possession of Secretary Clinton‚Äôs email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.‚Äù

He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print Dr. Eric Walsh (Photo: First Liberty) 
The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
The state‚Äôs demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
He‚Äôs getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
Walsh‚Äôs ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
Lee Rudd, the agency‚Äôs human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. 
At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin & Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
‚ÄúPolice State USA: How Orwell‚Äôs Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality‚Äù chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! 
Now, in response to Walsh‚Äôs lawsuit, the state delivered a ‚ÄúRequest for Production of Documents‚Äù that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, ‚Äúcopies of his sermon notes and transcripts.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThis is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church,‚Äù said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. 
‚ÄúNo government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons,‚Äù said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. ‚ÄúI cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.‚Äù 
Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Walsh‚Äôs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parker‚Äôs actions as possibly ‚Äúone of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen.‚Äù 
The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walsh‚Äôs case, Welch said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but Georgia‚Äôs demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from ‚Ä¶ us.‚Äù 
Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is ‚Äúworse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons.‚Äù 
‚ÄúFirst, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlso, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor‚Äôs preaching Bible. It‚Äôs almost as if they are ransacking the pastor‚Äôs study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America.‚Äù 
Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nation‚Äôs largest public policy women‚Äôs group with 500,000 members, also came to Walsh‚Äôs defense. 
Penny Nance, CEO, said: ‚ÄúThe words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, ‚ÄòInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,‚Äô still reverberate today ‚Äì especially as we witness the ‚ÄòGestapo-like‚Äô tactics of his native state. The state of Georgia‚Äôs blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. 
‚ÄúCan there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?‚Äù 
WND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walsh‚Äôs sermons and then fired him. 
‚ÄúNo one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon,‚Äù Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. ‚ÄúHe was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.‚Äù The original state investigation of Walsh‚Äôs sermons apparently was sparked by ‚Äúone complaint‚Äù from an official with a county Democratic Party and ‚Äúgay activist.‚Äù 
State officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. 
The telephone call was between Dr. Patrick O‚ÄôNeal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. 
Pfirman said: ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm gonna be very ‚Äì I‚Äôm gonna try to come off as very cold, because I don‚Äôt want to say very much. If I try to make it warm ‚Äì I‚Äôve thought that through, it‚Äôs gonna just not ‚Äì there‚Äôs no warm way to say it anyway.‚Äù 
Then there was laughter from both parties. 
O‚ÄôNeal then said to inform Walsh, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out,‚Äù and there was another round of laughter. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very funny,‚Äù Pfirman said.

Should President Trump try to prosecute Hillary? Sign the hottest petition in America now to show your support! 
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who the Republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment Trump‚Äôs getting. It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered,‚Äù Limbaugh said Wednesday. 
‚ÄúThey would go out of their way to find ways to destroy Jesus Christ if he could be nominated as a Republican. The Democrats would do everything they could, include calling Him a liar, the Bible a fake book, whatever it took.‚Äù Rush Limbaugh 
And despite the fact the Bible never indicates Jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, Limbaugh suggested Democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of His offspring: 
‚ÄúThey would scour the historical record looking for children He had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit Jesus. That‚Äôs who they are. That‚Äôs what they would do.‚Äù 
Limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that Republicans would never escape ‚Äúthis kind of media assault based on who we nominate.‚Äù Donald Trump‚Äôs RNC acceptance speech (Photo: Screenshot from RNC live feed) 
‚ÄúI say this because a lot of you Never Trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like Trump. No, it‚Äôs exactly what you get when you nominate a Republican. Whenever there is any opposition to the Democrats, this is what they do. It doesn‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôre gonna do it. They did it to Romney ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve made this point ‚Äôtil I blue in the face. They turned Romney, who is mild-mannered Mr. Gosh, Can‚Äôt Even Get Noticed into the biggest walking Satan, El Diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick So this is why I think Trump has so many people supporting him. He‚Äôs fighting back against it when most Republicans haven‚Äôt and don‚Äôt.‚Äù 
As an example of how media treatment of Republicans has not changed, Limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from CBS. Commentator Bill Moyers characterized the race before it was known that Republican Ronald Reagan would easily defeat Democrat Jimmy Carter. Moyers stated: 
‚ÄúThose of you who might speak Spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember,‚Äù said Carter, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs been your friend.‚Äù And there under the California sun in San Diego at a shopping center, Ronald Reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which he‚Äôs been a master since his days at Eureka College. Suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their ERA signs. Reagan took his cue and snapped back, ‚ÄúAw, shut up!‚Äù 
And thousands of supporters roared their approval. Those are the people for whom Ronald Reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. Jimmy Carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. Reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, ‚ÄúEnough‚Äôs enough.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDoes it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world?‚Äù Limbaugh asked. ‚ÄúNot an iota!‚Äù

A Hillary Clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a $20,000 donation funneled through a Belize bank to use in this year‚Äôs presidential election campaign ‚Äì until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by James O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs Project Veritas Action. 
Suddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donation‚Äôs overseas origin and decided to return it. 
That‚Äôs one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by O‚ÄôKeefe called ‚ÄúRigging the Election.‚Äù 
O‚ÄôKeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with Bob Creamer, who was a staffer at Americans United for Change, a group supporting Clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. 
He said Creamer, who boasted of working directly for the Clinton campaign, directed that the $20,000 donation go to AUFC ‚Äúto disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops.‚Äù 
O‚ÄôKeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves.

Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump‚Äôs call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! 
Project Veritas‚Äô first video explained how the Clinton campaign uses ‚Äúhidden connections‚Äù to incite violence at Donald Trump rallies. Its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed ‚Äúprohibited communications‚Äù between Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign, ‚Äúthe DNC and the nonprofit Americans United for Change.‚Äù 
The fourth video ‚Äúbreaks down the process of the long-term investigation.‚Äù It comes after Creamer‚Äôs announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. 
O‚ÄôKeefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. 
Among the revelations in the latest video was Creamer was boasting of his close links to President Obama. 
‚ÄúOh, Barack Obama‚Äôs was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good, too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pro, I‚Äôve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.‚Äù 
When asked whether a potential donor could meet Obama, Creamer said: ‚ÄúOK, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. I was just at an event with him in Chicago, Friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the ‚Ä¶ the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.‚Äù 
Explained Project Veritas: ‚ÄúThe more that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action‚Äôs $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos.‚Äù 
In the first video, Foval, a Democratic operative, boasted of what he called ‚Äúconflict engagement,‚Äù or sending protesters to disrupt Trump events. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting anarchy here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd he needs to understand that we‚Äôre starting anarchy.‚Äù 
In the second video, Creamer explained Clinton‚Äôs direct control over those disruption operations. 
‚ÄúIn the end it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future President of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground,‚Äù Creamer said. 
Creamer, the husband of Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
Here‚Äôs the third: 
That video also revealed a direct conflict between what Creamer was confirming ‚Äì Clinton‚Äôs active involvement in such decisions and campaigns ‚Äì and the claim of her campaign manager, Robby Mook. 
Mook told CNN over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and Clinton.

‚ÄúThese individuals no longer have a relationship with the DNC,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened I think in February of last year. 
‚ÄúThey did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we don‚Äôt know what the full context is. And there‚Äôs no evidence whatsoever ‚Ä¶ that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the DNC.‚Äù 
His comments: 
After confirming it was Clinton or ‚Äúwanted ducks on the ground,‚Äù Creamer warned undercover Project Veritas journalists, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt repeat that to anybody.‚Äù 
Creamer ran Democracy Partners, a consulting company with ties to Clinton. 
He has been to the White House 342 times while Obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with Obama. 
O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the DNC and the Americans United for Change ‚Äúsmacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures.‚Äù 
Last week , Project Veritas filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission asking for an investigation into the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúcriminal conspiracy.‚Äù 
The filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which Democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
The video have resulted already in two Democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
Editor‚Äôs Note: Be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
One is Scott Foval, who had worked for People for the American Way, a George Soros-funded group, and more recently with Americans United for Change. 
In the video, he said: ‚ÄúYou know what? We‚Äôve been busing people in to deal with you f‚Äîing a‚Äî‚Äìes for 50 years, and we‚Äôre not going to stop now.‚Äù 
Also, he said he and his agents are ‚Äústarting anarchy‚Äù by creating ‚Äúconflict engagement ‚Ä¶ in the lines at Trump rallies.‚Äù 
Also out of work is Creamer.

Theodore Roosevelt was born Oct. 27, 1858. His wife and mother died on Valentine‚Äôs Day, Feb. 14, 1884. He wrote in his diary ‚ÄúThe light has gone out in my life.‚Äù Depressed, he left to ranch in the Dakotas. 
Returning to New York, he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the Navy. He resigned during the Spanish-American War, organized the first Volunteer Cavalry, ‚Äúthe Rough Riders,‚Äù and captured Cuba‚Äôs San Juan Hill. Elected Vice-President under William McKinley, he became America‚Äôs youngest president in 1901. 
Republican Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to invite an African-American, Booker T. Washington, to dine in the White House on Oct. 16, 1901. A Southern Democrat newspapers condemned him it, as printed in the Memphis Scimitar: ‚ÄúThe most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the United States was committed yesterday by the President, when he invited a n- to dine with him at the White House.

In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt warned: ‚ÄúThe thought of modern industry in the hands of Christian charity is a dream worth dreaming. The thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. The choice between the two is upon us.‚Äù 
In 1917, the New York Bible Society had Theodore Roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket New Testament & Book of Psalms given to World War I soldiers: ‚ÄúThe teachings of the New Testament are foreshadowed in Micah‚Äôs verse (Micah vi. 8): ‚ÄòWhat more does the Lord require of thee than to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?‚Äô Do justice; and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of Germany and Turkey, for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of Moloch and Beelzebub on this earth. Love mercy; treat prisoners well, succor the wounded, treat every woman as if she was your sister, care for the little children, and be tender to the old and helpless. Walk humbly; You will do so if you study the life and teachings of the Saviour. May the God of justice and mercy have you in His keeping. ‚Äì (signed) Theodore Roosevelt.‚Äù

Theodore Roosevelt, in his book ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Own Part‚Äù (NY: George H. Doran Co., 1916), wrote: 
Armenians ‚Ä¶ for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war ‚Ä¶ are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors, the Turks, have not been pacifists but militarists. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 61, 64) 
Armenians, have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the Napoleonic Wars‚Ä¶the wars of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane in Asia. Yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged. ‚Ä¶ This course of national infamy ‚Ä¶ began when the last Administration surrendered to the peace at-any-price people, and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties. Individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milk-and-water invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of blood-and-iron. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 111) 
American eye-witness of the fearful atrocities, Mr. Arthur H. Gleason (New York Tribune, Nov. 25, 1915)‚Ä¶ Serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish. Now, the Armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an old-time Apache Indian. ‚Ä¶ 
Even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heaped-up horrors of the past year and a half, the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the Armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation. Let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation, and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds. ‚Ä¶ If this people through its government had not shirked its duty ‚Ä¶ we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of Armenia. 
Mass meetings on behalf of the Armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them. ‚Ä¶ The principles of the peace-at-any-price men, of the professional pacifists ‚Ä¶ will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness. ‚Ä¶ This crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the Armenians ‚Ä¶ must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the United States for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed. ‚Ä¶ The devastation of Poland and Serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenth-century Europe. ‚Ä¶ 
Weak and timid milk-and-water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood-and-iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world. The crowning outrage has been committed by the Turks on the Armenians. They have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them, atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of Attila and of Genghis Khan. 
It is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks ‚Äòneutral not only in deed but in thought,‚Äô between right and the most hideous wrong, neutral between despairing and hunted people, people whose little children are murdered and their women raped, and the victorious and evil wrong-doers. ‚Ä¶ 
I trust that all Americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful Armenian atrocities. I trust that they feel ‚Ä¶ that a peace obtained without ‚Ä¶ righting the wrongs of the Armenians would be worse than any war. ‚Ä¶ 
Wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just, who put honor above safety, who are true to a lofty ideal of duty, who prepare in advance to make their strength effective, and who shrink from no hazard, not even the final hazard of war, if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness. When our people take this stand, we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesses‚Ä¶on an even greater scale in Armenia. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, pp. 377-383) 
In his book ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Part,‚Äù 1916, Theodore Roosevelt wrote: 
Christianity is not the creed of Asia and Africa at this moment solely because the seventh century Christians of Asia and Africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the Moslems were trained to fight. Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought. 
If the peoples of Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and on up to and including the 17th century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the Mohammedans who invaded Europe, Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated. 
A contemporary of Theodore Roosevelt was the English author G.K. Chesterton, who wrote of Western Christian civilization (‚ÄúThe Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton: Volume XX,‚Äù Introduction and Notes by James V. Schall, Ignatius Press): ‚ÄúThey seem entirely to forget that long before the Crusaders had dreamed of riding to Jerusalem, the Moslems had almost ridden into Paris.‚Äù 
Theodore Roosevelt continued in ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Part,‚Äù 1916: ‚ÄúWherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, Christianity has ultimately disappeared. From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Jan Sobieski, Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor.‚Äù

Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybody‚Äôs problem ‚Äì except their own? 
For the federal government, it‚Äôs always easy and tempting to look at problems ‚Äì real or imagined ‚Äì outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. 
Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on ‚Äúinteractions between law enforcement and civilians,‚Äù she reported this month. 
‚ÄúAccurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúIn the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.‚Äù 
The irony here is thick, indeed. 
One of Lynch‚Äôs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life ‚Äì namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nation‚Äôs capital. 
Lynch wants reports? 
So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things: Missing Evidence The 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide ‚Äì or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officer‚Äôs life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Carey‚Äôs head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayor‚Äôs office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked ‚ÄúEvidence.‚Äù Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated: ‚ÄúThere were seventy-two (72) witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit (TSU) located at the IAD.‚Äù Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses‚Äô own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as ‚Äúcop talk.‚Äù White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions (instant messaging) between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
We‚Äôve been at this for a long time ‚Äì years. Yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

‚Äú I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women‚Äôs rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. ‚Äù 
‚Äì Hillary Clinton 
The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate) was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing ‚Äúdog whistle politics,‚Äù rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clinton‚Äôs response to Wallace‚Äôs question (where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted) however, was representative of this tactic. 
While women‚Äôs rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court (since objectively, women wouldn‚Äôt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population), Clinton‚Äôs answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs rights‚Äù is of course ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. ‚ÄúLGBT rights‚Äù is ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. (at least not at present); however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clinton‚Äôs overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
Clinton‚Äôs reference to ‚Äúpowerful corporations and the wealthy‚Äù and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for ‚Äúdark, unaccountable money,‚Äù the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros, the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. 
One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clinton‚Äôs debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date ‚Äì and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office ‚Äì should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press (mainstream media), there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obama‚Äôs rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
In recent days, we‚Äôve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that‚Äôs been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clinton‚Äôs popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. 
The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans ‚Äì not just voters, and not just Republicans ‚Äì need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
The burning question is this: In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

dbcce1b01ac8d83098b30eaf70846b2ab115adc2	"While Democrats perpetually circle the wagons, Republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. The same holds true for many evangelicals. Democrats and secularists count on it. 
And we never disappoint. 
Full disclosure: I went from a dogged ‚ÄúNever Trumper‚Äù to a ‚ÄúMaybe Trumper‚Äù and, finally, settled as a ‚ÄúReluctant Trumper.‚Äù I, like any God-fearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by Donald Trump‚Äôs sordid past, and his 11-year-old vulgar video in which he objectified women. His words are indefensible, and I fully expect the Clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the Republican nominee before Election Day. 
Still, I will be voting against Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible: by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of Donald Trump ‚Äì and for the vice presidency of Gov. Mike Pence. 
Regrettably, with many of my Never Trump friends I‚Äôm reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself (and others) of the strength of his own faith. Pride is an awful thing. We are to be ‚Äúwise as serpents and innocent as doves‚Äù (Matthew 10:16). Foolishness called ‚Äúfaith‚Äù is just foolishness. 
Even so, there are Christian Pharisees on both extremes of this Trump fiasco: first, those Trumpian cultists who buy the ‚ÄúMake America great again!‚Äù pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. The latter say they‚Äôll sit this one out (or go through the motions by voting third party ‚Äì a wasted vote by any objective standard). While I appreciate this milder strain of Never Trumper‚Äôs sincerity, I nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. 
And then there are the self-righteous, plank-in-the-eye Never Trump prigs who slander as having ‚Äúlost their saltiness,‚Äù‚Äúsinned against God‚Äù and ‚Äúcompromised their principles,‚Äù brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed (Lord knows I‚Äôm the worst sinner of all) baby Christian as president is a vote against Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tyranny in perpetuity. 
The Media Research Center has done America a tremendous service. In 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion ‚Äì something Hillary Clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. I plead with Never Trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for Nov. 8. 
Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs beloved late-term abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the left-leaning American Medical Association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for ‚Äúthe life or health of the mother.‚Äù 
During a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully ‚Äúviable‚Äù child ‚Äì often kicking and thrashing ‚Äì feet first from her mother‚Äôs womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. This is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. 
He then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. Next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. 
Her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. 
This is homicide, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton supports it. Donald Trump opposes it. 
We deserve God‚Äôs wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. In my estimation, Mrs. Clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. Her Supreme Court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. 
My conscience tells me that I must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against Mrs. Clinton and ensure that she is stopped. She must not be elected president. To not vote ‚Äì or to vote for a non-starter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing ‚Äì while not an actual vote for Mrs. Clinton, still puts this Mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the White House and the Supreme Court. 
It‚Äôs simple math, and it‚Äôs undeniable. The most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against Mrs. Clinton by voting for Mr. Trump. This does the most electoral damage possible to candidate Clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. 
With its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the U.S. Supreme Court put the government‚Äôs official stamp of approval on mass murder. Since then, the battle lines have been drawn. This is war. ‚ÄúPro-choicers‚Äù are the bad guys and pro-lifers, the good guys. It really is that simple ‚Äì that black and white. It‚Äôs good versus evil. 
History will reflect as much. 
Under a President Hillary Clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. Under a President Donald Trump, these millions might live. And yet, even as Hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over Donald‚Äôs potty mouth. 
The devil and Democrats: Oh, how they love derision and division within the body of Christ."	bias
9fa953d2365f9642b5003b66957a77efe539c6fd	"Election crossroads: Socialism or capitalism? Exclusive: Jane Chastain explains impact of Dems' 'living wage' proposal Published: 20 mins ago Jane Chastain About | | Archive Jane Chastain is a Southern California-based broadcaster, author and political commentator. Despite her present emphasis on politics, Jane always will be remembered as the nation's first female TV sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. Jane blogs at JaneChastain.com. She is a pilot who lives on a private runway. Print 
Our country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
It is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lion‚Äôs share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
We‚Äôve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isn‚Äôt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
Notice what I didn‚Äôt say is ‚Äúsimply willing to work hard.‚Äù There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù ‚Äì the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around $85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
Ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
Unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
But this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
This, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
Wages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
Most people simply do not understand that businesses don‚Äôt pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as we‚Äôve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. That‚Äôs when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. That‚Äôs when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. 
They tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college ‚Äì or almost free loans ‚Äì in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we don‚Äôt get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country! 
If we don‚Äôt reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isn‚Äôt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
What about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke? How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? They never talk about that. 
As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, ‚ÄúThe problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people‚Äôs money.‚Äù 
Don‚Äôt be fooled: This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. It‚Äôs an important fork in the road: One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch.

Before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. 
First, I‚Äôm writing this because I have been asked incessantly for months how I would be voting, not because I think I‚Äôm someone special or that what I do should influence you. 
Second, I‚Äôm not endorsing Donald Trump. In my mind, there‚Äôs a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. 
Third, I respect those in the #NeverTrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. Among the #NeverTrump voices I respect are columnists like David French and Ben Shapiro, bloggers like Matt Walsh and evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Beth Moore. 
Fourth, I take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were St. Donald. I also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Trump‚Äôs failings, constantly saying, ‚ÄúLet him who is without sin cast the first one‚Äù (see John 8:7). This is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. 
Fifth, my decision to vote for Trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and Nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been: 1) During the GOP primaries, I issued strong warnings against voting for Trump while we had other excellent choices. I did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if Trump won the nomination, I would re-evaluate my position. 2) Once Trump became the Republican candidate, I wrote that I was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3) I have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would I vote for Hillary. (For two strong warnings about Hillary, see here and here .) 
So, what has convinced me that I should now vote for Donald Trump? 
The culture war is not over! Gain hope, courage and practical advice in Michael Brown‚Äôs latest book, ‚ÄúOutlasting the Gay Revolution: Where Homosexual Activism Is Really Going and How to Turn the Tide‚Äù 
First, I believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-Constitution Supreme Court justices. When he said during the last debate that if you‚Äôre pro-life, you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his Gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. 
Second, one reason I endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican, to the point of calling it the Washington cartel. Trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system (although, unfortunately, he‚Äôs been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system), so my vote for him is also a protest vote. 
Third, I am voting for the Republican platform, not the Republican Party, which means I‚Äôm in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. 
Fourth, while I have always felt that the line, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre electing a president, not a pastor,‚Äù was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor,‚Äù it might have more relevance. In other words, we are not looking for Trump to be a moral reformer (even if hedoes appoint righteous judges), and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example (although we pray he will be truly converted and become one). Rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. And with things so messed up in America, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. 
Fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between Hillary and Trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the LGBT agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. Since I have the opportunity to vote, I feel that I should vote for Trump. 
Sixth, Trump continues to be drawn to conservative Christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. One of my dear friends has spent hours with Trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Trump. Yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. While I am not one of those claiming that Trump is a born-again Christian (I see absolutely no evidence of this), the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. It also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. 
Seventh, although I‚Äôm quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, I‚Äôm far more concerned with what we as God‚Äôs people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of America is much more important than the state of the White House. In that context, I echo the words (and warning) of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: ‚ÄúThe church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. If the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority.‚Äù 
So, in sum: 1) My hope is in God, not Donald Trump, and I do recognize that either Hillary or Trump has the potential to do great harm to America; 2) My urgent call is for us as followers of Jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3) I will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Hillary Clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4) Ultimately, the most effective way to defeat Hillary is to vote for Trump, while also praying that God will use him for good , not for evil. 
In the end, if Trump gets elected and fails miserably, I will be grieved but not devastated. If he does well, I will rejoice. 
Either way, though, my vote is just that: a vote. My greater role is to live a life pleasing to God with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution.

Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn‚Äôt help that white voters can‚Äôt agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they‚Äôll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats ‚Äì the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else ‚Äì the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future ‚Äì or any Third World country. Or to Univision‚Äôs Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture‚Äôs acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that ‚Äúthe male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. ‚Ä¶ Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.‚Äù 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about child rape because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a cultural thing.‚Äù 
When it comes to multiculturalism, you can‚Äôt say, We love the empanadas ‚Äì but we don‚Äôt want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn‚Äôt an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we‚Äôre importing. 
As described in excruciating detail in ‚ÄúAdios, America: The Left‚Äôs Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole,‚Äù our media already have a totally ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about incest and child rape ‚Äì and murder! ‚Äì when it‚Äôs committed by immigrants. 
Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: ‚ÄúIllegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,‚Äù the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: ‚ÄúMan guilty in case of human smuggling.‚Äù 
And where I would have used the headline, ‚ÄúIllegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,‚Äù the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, ‚ÄúColumbus resident charged with molestation.‚Äù 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too ‚Äì provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from ‚Äútraditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.‚Äù The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. 
Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) 
In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) 
Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for ‚ÄúAustin men.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù 
Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: 
‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo held in attack on child‚Äù ‚Äì Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 
‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack‚Äù ‚Äì Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 
Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
The ultimate primer on the ‚Äúblue-collar billionaire‚Äù‚Äî order Ann Coulter‚Äôs book ‚ÄúIn Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!‚Äù 
By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape ‚Äì of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
The second case only was ‚Äúrape‚Äù because of the girl‚Äôs young age ‚Äì she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. 
That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? 
When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. 
Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters‚Äô American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) 
Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan‚Äôs rape: 
‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy We Need Women in War Zones‚Äù (‚ÄúI would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. ‚Ä¶ This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.‚Äù) 
‚Äì ‚ÄúReporting While Female‚Äù (‚ÄúWomen reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. ‚Ä¶ In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.‚Äù) 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans ‚Äì or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but ‚Äì if all goes according to the Democrats‚Äô plan ‚Äì they‚Äôll get to be Mugabe!

Two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered NFL fan. The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is ‚Äúracist‚Äù because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him ‚Äúmy African-American.‚Äù Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-Semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husband‚Äôs former congressional campaign manager as a ‚Äúf‚Äì-ing Jew bastard.‚Äù 
With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies ‚Äì big or small, real or imagined ‚Äì while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfailure to ever apologize‚Äù outweighs an examination of Clinton‚Äôs flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about ‚Äútoddlers,‚Äù as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word ‚Äútoddler‚Äù appear. Clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.‚Äù To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an ‚Äúemail scandal,‚Äù when the accurate description is ‚Äúnational security scandal.‚Äù The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an ‚Äúintent.‚Äù Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was ‚Äúhacked.‚Äù 
Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the ‚Äútarget,‚Äù that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals? Who knows ‚Äì and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
Clinton insists that ‚ÄúPresident Obama doesn‚Äôt get enough credit‚Äù for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls ‚Äúthe big lie,‚Äù given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
Meanwhile, it‚Äôs yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trump‚Äôs sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husband‚Äôs accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. 
Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Ever. Clinton‚Äôs answer? He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to ‚Äúsimply deny it.‚Äù Same answer: ‚ÄúMy attorney ‚Ä¶ speaks for me.‚Äù And that was that. 
So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy that‚Äôs given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nation‚Äôs security at risk; who told the Benghazi victim‚Äôs families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the Second Amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States.

(American Prospect) ‚Äî When, as a campaign surrogate and once-powerful white man, you answer allegations that your candidate may be a sexual predator with a sex-laced attack on your female interviewer, you‚Äôre probably a misogynist. A desperate misogynist. 
That‚Äôs what former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is looking like this morning. 
During a Tuesday discussion of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs sinking poll numbers, Gingrich accused Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly of being ‚Äúfascinated with sex‚Äù when she dared to mention that Trump‚Äôs fortunes began falling after the now infamous Access Hollywood video, featuring Trump boasting about his self-proclaimed prerogative to sexually assault women, became public on October 7, and nearly a dozen women came forward to allege that Trump had either assaulted them or otherwise taken liberties with their bodies."	bias

(National Review) ‚Äî What was the legal rationale under which Hillary Clinton quite intentionally shared classified information with her lawyers, including David Kendall, Cheryl Mills, and Heather Samuelson? 
As I outlined in last weekend‚Äôs column, we know that Clinton‚Äôs e-mails were replete with classified information. According to the FBI, the classified e-mails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level: eight top-secret e-mails, and seven designated as ‚Äúspecial access program‚Äù (SAP) information. (While FBI director James Comey‚Äôs presentation understandably left this vague, the likelihood is that seven of the eight top-secret e-mails are SAP.) Under President Bill Clinton‚Äôs 1995 executive order, top-secret intelligence is information the mishandling of which ‚Äúcould be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.‚Äù The SAP designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligence-gathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources. 
That is why access to this information is so tightly restricted, and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted."	bias
8b68a43f03985d72a1f076823c749579436b1ee4	"Print Side-by-side of Bill Clinton and Danney Williams 
NEW YORK ‚ÄìYouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30-year-old who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. 
YouTube, citing ‚Äúrepeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines,‚Äù declared the account ‚Äúcannot be restored.‚Äù 
The YouTube decision blocked the nine-minute feature ‚ÄúBANISHED ‚Äì The Untold Story of Danney Williams,‚Äù which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. 
Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America‚Äôs independent news network. 
‚ÄúMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,‚Äù Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube‚Äôs decision. ‚Äú[YouTube] can‚Äôt handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.‚Äù 
Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the ‚ÄúBanished‚Äù video on Danney Williams‚Äô page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : ‚ÄúThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.‚Äù 
The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton‚Äôs Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. 
Attempt to silence Danney Williams? 
Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
‚ÄúThe behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney‚Äôs account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,‚Äù Gilbert said. 
Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
‚ÄúThe only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, ‚Äòto run him off the plantation‚Äô as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor‚Äôs mansion in 1990,‚Äù Gilbert said. 
‚ÄúDanney cannot be silenced any longer,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it‚Äôs not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.‚Äù 
See the Danney Williams video feature: 
WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. 
No definitive DNA test 
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams‚Äô claim first surfaced. 
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a ‚ÄúDNA showdown‚Äù proving Bill Clinton was not Williams‚Äô father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, ‚ÄúThere was no match, nothing even close.‚Äù 
But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton‚Äôs DNA,‚Äù Bunton told WND. 
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. 
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. 
‚ÄúWe got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,‚Äù Bunton recalled to WND. ‚ÄúWe thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.‚Äù 
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 
‚ÄòTwitter rules‚Äô 
Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O‚ÄôKeefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O‚ÄôKeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of ‚ÄúTwitter Rules.‚Äù The notice said he ‚Äúmust delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users‚Äô private information‚Äù or violating ‚Äúother rules.‚Äù In a statement, O‚ÄôKeefe said he relies on social media to ‚Äúbypass the media and directly reach the public.‚Äù On Monday, O‚ÄôKeefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù Earlier this month, O‚ÄôKeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn‚Äôt show up on Google‚Äôs ‚Äútrending‚Äù list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his ‚ÄúGays for Trump‚Äù party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Ashamed,‚Äù about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie‚Äôs entire channel was suspended . 
Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend‚Äôs account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schooler‚Äôs account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs comment that Obama ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt love America.‚Äù The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS."	bias

Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybody‚Äôs problem ‚Äì except their own? 
For the federal government, it‚Äôs always easy and tempting to look at problems ‚Äì real or imagined ‚Äì outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. 
Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on ‚Äúinteractions between law enforcement and civilians,‚Äù she reported this month. 
‚ÄúAccurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúIn the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.‚Äù 
The irony here is thick, indeed. 
One of Lynch‚Äôs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life ‚Äì namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nation‚Äôs capital. 
Lynch wants reports? 
So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things: Missing Evidence The 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide ‚Äì or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officer‚Äôs life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Carey‚Äôs head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayor‚Äôs office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked ‚ÄúEvidence.‚Äù Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated: ‚ÄúThere were seventy-two (72) witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit (TSU) located at the IAD.‚Äù Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses‚Äô own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as ‚Äúcop talk.‚Äù White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions (instant messaging) between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
We‚Äôve been at this for a long time ‚Äì years. Yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

His latest book is ""Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal - America's Racial Obsession."" In 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of Sen.

‚Äú I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women‚Äôs rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. ‚Äù 
‚Äì Hillary Clinton 
The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate) was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing ‚Äúdog whistle politics,‚Äù rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clinton‚Äôs response to Wallace‚Äôs question (where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted) however, was representative of this tactic. 
While women‚Äôs rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court (since objectively, women wouldn‚Äôt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population), Clinton‚Äôs answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs rights‚Äù is of course ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. ‚ÄúLGBT rights‚Äù is ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. (at least not at present); however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clinton‚Äôs overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
Clinton‚Äôs reference to ‚Äúpowerful corporations and the wealthy‚Äù and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for ‚Äúdark, unaccountable money,‚Äù the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros, the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. 
One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clinton‚Äôs debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date ‚Äì and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office ‚Äì should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press (mainstream media), there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obama‚Äôs rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
In recent days, we‚Äôve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that‚Äôs been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clinton‚Äôs popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. 
The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans ‚Äì not just voters, and not just Republicans ‚Äì need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
The burning question is this: In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

e142ad0523261508c8552ed5f61916e99da0489a	"While Democrats perpetually circle the wagons, Republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. The same holds true for many evangelicals. Democrats and secularists count on it. 
And we never disappoint. 
Full disclosure: I went from a dogged ‚ÄúNever Trumper‚Äù to a ‚ÄúMaybe Trumper‚Äù and, finally, settled as a ‚ÄúReluctant Trumper.‚Äù I, like any God-fearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by Donald Trump‚Äôs sordid past, and his 11-year-old vulgar video in which he objectified women. His words are indefensible, and I fully expect the Clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the Republican nominee before Election Day. 
Still, I will be voting against Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible: by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of Donald Trump ‚Äì and for the vice presidency of Gov. Mike Pence. 
Regrettably, with many of my Never Trump friends I‚Äôm reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself (and others) of the strength of his own faith. Pride is an awful thing. We are to be ‚Äúwise as serpents and innocent as doves‚Äù (Matthew 10:16). Foolishness called ‚Äúfaith‚Äù is just foolishness. 
Even so, there are Christian Pharisees on both extremes of this Trump fiasco: first, those Trumpian cultists who buy the ‚ÄúMake America great again!‚Äù pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. The latter say they‚Äôll sit this one out (or go through the motions by voting third party ‚Äì a wasted vote by any objective standard). While I appreciate this milder strain of Never Trumper‚Äôs sincerity, I nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. 
And then there are the self-righteous, plank-in-the-eye Never Trump prigs who slander as having ‚Äúlost their saltiness,‚Äù‚Äúsinned against God‚Äù and ‚Äúcompromised their principles,‚Äù brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed (Lord knows I‚Äôm the worst sinner of all) baby Christian as president is a vote against Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tyranny in perpetuity. 
The Media Research Center has done America a tremendous service. In 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion ‚Äì something Hillary Clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. I plead with Never Trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for Nov. 8. 
Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs beloved late-term abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the left-leaning American Medical Association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for ‚Äúthe life or health of the mother.‚Äù 
During a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully ‚Äúviable‚Äù child ‚Äì often kicking and thrashing ‚Äì feet first from her mother‚Äôs womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. This is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. 
He then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. Next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. 
Her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. 
This is homicide, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton supports it. Donald Trump opposes it. 
We deserve God‚Äôs wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. In my estimation, Mrs. Clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. Her Supreme Court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. 
My conscience tells me that I must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against Mrs. Clinton and ensure that she is stopped. She must not be elected president. To not vote ‚Äì or to vote for a non-starter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing ‚Äì while not an actual vote for Mrs. Clinton, still puts this Mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the White House and the Supreme Court. 
It‚Äôs simple math, and it‚Äôs undeniable. The most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against Mrs. Clinton by voting for Mr. Trump. This does the most electoral damage possible to candidate Clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. 
With its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the U.S. Supreme Court put the government‚Äôs official stamp of approval on mass murder. Since then, the battle lines have been drawn. This is war. ‚ÄúPro-choicers‚Äù are the bad guys and pro-lifers, the good guys. It really is that simple ‚Äì that black and white. It‚Äôs good versus evil. 
History will reflect as much. 
Under a President Hillary Clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. Under a President Donald Trump, these millions might live. And yet, even as Hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over Donald‚Äôs potty mouth. 
The devil and Democrats: Oh, how they love derision and division within the body of Christ."	bias
c69797f3a44314f780b597a90990acab17b2ffeb	"Election crossroads: Socialism or capitalism? Exclusive: Jane Chastain explains impact of Dems' 'living wage' proposal Published: 49 mins ago About | | Archive Jane Chastain is a Southern California-based broadcaster, author and political commentator. Despite her present emphasis on politics, Jane always will be remembered as the nation's first female TV sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. Jane blogs at JaneChastain.com. She is a pilot who lives on a private runway. Print 
Our country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
It is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lion‚Äôs share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
We‚Äôve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isn‚Äôt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
Notice what I didn‚Äôt say is ‚Äúsimply willing to work hard.‚Äù There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù ‚Äì the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around $85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
Ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
Unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
But this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
This, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
Wages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
Most people simply do not understand that businesses don‚Äôt pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as we‚Äôve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. That‚Äôs when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. That‚Äôs when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. 
They tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college ‚Äì or almost free loans ‚Äì in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we don‚Äôt get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country! 
If we don‚Äôt reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isn‚Äôt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
What about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke? How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? They never talk about that. 
As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, ‚ÄúThe problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people‚Äôs money.‚Äù 
Don‚Äôt be fooled: This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. It‚Äôs an important fork in the road: One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch.

Before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. 
First, I‚Äôm writing this because I have been asked incessantly for months how I would be voting, not because I think I‚Äôm someone special or that what I do should influence you. 
Second, I‚Äôm not endorsing Donald Trump. In my mind, there‚Äôs a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. 
Third, I respect those in the #NeverTrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. Among the #NeverTrump voices I respect are columnists like David French and Ben Shapiro, bloggers like Matt Walsh and evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Beth Moore. 
Fourth, I take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were St. Donald. I also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Trump‚Äôs failings, constantly saying, ‚ÄúLet him who is without sin cast the first one‚Äù (see John 8:7). This is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. 
Fifth, my decision to vote for Trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and Nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been: 1) During the GOP primaries, I issued strong warnings against voting for Trump while we had other excellent choices. I did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if Trump won the nomination, I would re-evaluate my position. 2) Once Trump became the Republican candidate, I wrote that I was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3) I have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would I vote for Hillary. (For two strong warnings about Hillary, see here and here .) 
So, what has convinced me that I should now vote for Donald Trump? 
The culture war is not over! Gain hope, courage and practical advice in Michael Brown‚Äôs latest book, ‚ÄúOutlasting the Gay Revolution: Where Homosexual Activism Is Really Going and How to Turn the Tide‚Äù 
First, I believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-Constitution Supreme Court justices. When he said during the last debate that if you‚Äôre pro-life, you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his Gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. 
Second, one reason I endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican, to the point of calling it the Washington cartel. Trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system (although, unfortunately, he‚Äôs been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system), so my vote for him is also a protest vote. 
Third, I am voting for the Republican platform, not the Republican Party, which means I‚Äôm in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. 
Fourth, while I have always felt that the line, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre electing a president, not a pastor,‚Äù was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor,‚Äù it might have more relevance. In other words, we are not looking for Trump to be a moral reformer (even if hedoes appoint righteous judges), and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example (although we pray he will be truly converted and become one). Rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. And with things so messed up in America, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. 
Fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between Hillary and Trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the LGBT agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. Since I have the opportunity to vote, I feel that I should vote for Trump. 
Sixth, Trump continues to be drawn to conservative Christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. One of my dear friends has spent hours with Trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Trump. Yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. While I am not one of those claiming that Trump is a born-again Christian (I see absolutely no evidence of this), the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. It also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. 
Seventh, although I‚Äôm quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, I‚Äôm far more concerned with what we as God‚Äôs people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of America is much more important than the state of the White House. In that context, I echo the words (and warning) of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: ‚ÄúThe church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. If the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority.‚Äù 
So, in sum: 1) My hope is in God, not Donald Trump, and I do recognize that either Hillary or Trump has the potential to do great harm to America; 2) My urgent call is for us as followers of Jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3) I will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Hillary Clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4) Ultimately, the most effective way to defeat Hillary is to vote for Trump, while also praying that God will use him for good , not for evil. 
In the end, if Trump gets elected and fails miserably, I will be grieved but not devastated. If he does well, I will rejoice. 
Either way, though, my vote is just that: a vote. My greater role is to live a life pleasing to God with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution.

Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn‚Äôt help that white voters can‚Äôt agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they‚Äôll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats ‚Äì the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else ‚Äì the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future ‚Äì or any Third World country. Or to Univision‚Äôs Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture‚Äôs acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that ‚Äúthe male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. ‚Ä¶ Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.‚Äù 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about child rape because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a cultural thing.‚Äù 
When it comes to multiculturalism, you can‚Äôt say, We love the empanadas ‚Äì but we don‚Äôt want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn‚Äôt an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we‚Äôre importing. 
As described in excruciating detail in ‚ÄúAdios, America: The Left‚Äôs Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole,‚Äù our media already have a totally ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about incest and child rape ‚Äì and murder! ‚Äì when it‚Äôs committed by immigrants. 
Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: ‚ÄúIllegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,‚Äù the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: ‚ÄúMan guilty in case of human smuggling.‚Äù 
And where I would have used the headline, ‚ÄúIllegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,‚Äù the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, ‚ÄúColumbus resident charged with molestation.‚Äù 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too ‚Äì provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from ‚Äútraditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.‚Äù The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. 
Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) 
In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) 
Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for ‚ÄúAustin men.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù 
Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: 
‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo held in attack on child‚Äù ‚Äì Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 
‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack‚Äù ‚Äì Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 
Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
The ultimate primer on the ‚Äúblue-collar billionaire‚Äù‚Äî order Ann Coulter‚Äôs book ‚ÄúIn Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!‚Äù 
By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape ‚Äì of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
The second case only was ‚Äúrape‚Äù because of the girl‚Äôs young age ‚Äì she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. 
That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? 
When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. 
Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters‚Äô American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) 
Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan‚Äôs rape: 
‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy We Need Women in War Zones‚Äù (‚ÄúI would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. ‚Ä¶ This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.‚Äù) 
‚Äì ‚ÄúReporting While Female‚Äù (‚ÄúWomen reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. ‚Ä¶ In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.‚Äù) 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans ‚Äì or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but ‚Äì if all goes according to the Democrats‚Äô plan ‚Äì they‚Äôll get to be Mugabe!

Two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered NFL fan. The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is ‚Äúracist‚Äù because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him ‚Äúmy African-American.‚Äù Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-Semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husband‚Äôs former congressional campaign manager as a ‚Äúf‚Äì-ing Jew bastard.‚Äù 
With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies ‚Äì big or small, real or imagined ‚Äì while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfailure to ever apologize‚Äù outweighs an examination of Clinton‚Äôs flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about ‚Äútoddlers,‚Äù as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word ‚Äútoddler‚Äù appear. Clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.‚Äù To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an ‚Äúemail scandal,‚Äù when the accurate description is ‚Äúnational security scandal.‚Äù The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an ‚Äúintent.‚Äù Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was ‚Äúhacked.‚Äù 
Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the ‚Äútarget,‚Äù that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals? Who knows ‚Äì and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
Clinton insists that ‚ÄúPresident Obama doesn‚Äôt get enough credit‚Äù for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls ‚Äúthe big lie,‚Äù given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
Meanwhile, it‚Äôs yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trump‚Äôs sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husband‚Äôs accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. 
Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Ever. Clinton‚Äôs answer? He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to ‚Äúsimply deny it.‚Äù Same answer: ‚ÄúMy attorney ‚Ä¶ speaks for me.‚Äù And that was that. 
So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy that‚Äôs given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nation‚Äôs security at risk; who told the Benghazi victim‚Äôs families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the Second Amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States.

YouTube, citing ‚Äúrepeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines,‚Äù declared the account ‚Äúcannot be restored.‚Äù 
The YouTube decision blocked the nine-minute feature ‚ÄúBANISHED ‚Äì The Untold Story of Danney Williams,‚Äù which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity.

‚ÄúMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,‚Äù Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube‚Äôs decision. ‚Äú[YouTube] can‚Äôt handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.‚Äù 
Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the ‚ÄúBanished‚Äù video on Danney Williams‚Äô page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : ‚ÄúThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.‚Äù 
The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton‚Äôs Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. 
Attempt to silence Danney Williams? 
Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
‚ÄúThe behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney‚Äôs account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,‚Äù Gilbert said. 
Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
‚ÄúThe only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, ‚Äòto run him off the plantation‚Äô as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor‚Äôs mansion in 1990,‚Äù Gilbert said. 
‚ÄúDanney cannot be silenced any longer,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it‚Äôs not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.‚Äù 
See the Danney Williams video feature: 
WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. 
No definitive DNA test 
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams‚Äô claim first surfaced. 
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a ‚ÄúDNA showdown‚Äù proving Bill Clinton was not Williams‚Äô father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, ‚ÄúThere was no match, nothing even close.‚Äù 
But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton‚Äôs DNA,‚Äù Bunton told WND. 
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. 
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. 
‚ÄúWe got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,‚Äù Bunton recalled to WND. ‚ÄúWe thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.‚Äù 
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 
‚ÄòTwitter rules‚Äô 
Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O‚ÄôKeefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O‚ÄôKeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of ‚ÄúTwitter Rules.‚Äù The notice said he ‚Äúmust delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users‚Äô private information‚Äù or violating ‚Äúother rules.‚Äù In a statement, O‚ÄôKeefe said he relies on social media to ‚Äúbypass the media and directly reach the public.‚Äù On Monday, O‚ÄôKeefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù Earlier this month, O‚ÄôKeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn‚Äôt show up on Google‚Äôs ‚Äútrending‚Äù list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his ‚ÄúGays for Trump‚Äù party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Ashamed,‚Äù about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie‚Äôs entire channel was suspended . 
Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend‚Äôs account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schooler‚Äôs account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs comment that Obama ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt love America.‚Äù The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS."	bias

He has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh, North Carolina. Print Hillary Clinton with top aide Huma Abedin. 
WikiLeaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what Hillary Clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but Clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. 
She has focused instead on criticizing the Russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of Russian involvement. 
The emails also shed light on how the Clinton campaign interacts with Wall Street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders with the help of the DNC. 
WikiLeaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, a senior Democratic Party official who has served as White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to President Obama. He was the author of Obama‚Äôs climate change policy. John Podesta 
In February Podesta moved seamlessly from the White House to become chairman of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign. 
Here are some of the most explosive revelations from the WikiLeaks email dumps featuring Podesta‚Äôs account and others. 
Preference for Muslim Americans In 2008, when Podesta served as co-chair of President-elect Barack Obama‚Äôs transition team, Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, sent Podesta a ‚Äúlist of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates.‚Äù The Arab American list came with a special note to exclude Arab Christians ‚Äì they had to be both Arab and Muslim.As New Republic reports, Obama‚Äôs eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as Froman recommended.Froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. 
Shielding Obama In a March 4, 2015, email to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lawyer Cheryl Mills, Clinton‚Äôs eventual campaign chairman Podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between Clinton and President Obama that were sent over Clinton‚Äôs private server.The day before Podesta sent his email to Mills, the House Benghazi Committee privately told Clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.The email from Podesta to Mills says: ‚ÄúThink we should hold emails to and from potus? That‚Äôs the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will.‚Äù An email exchange between Podesta, Paul Begala, and Clinton pollster GQRR shows the Clinton campaign was pushing the Muslim Obama narrative back in January 2008. Included was a survey of Obama ‚Äúnegative facts‚Äù such as this one: ‚ÄúObama (owe-BAHM-uh)‚Äôs father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world‚Äôs most populous Islamic country.‚Äù The pollster writes ‚Äúwe have reworked the Obama message into the survey, as requested.‚Äù 
Secret speeches to Wall Street Hillary Clinton was so enraged that Bill Clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley in 2015 that she ‚Äúneeded a cool down period.‚Äù The email chain, on March 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton, and reveals that Hillary‚Äôs future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of Bill giving a speech to a Wall Street bank. ‚ÄúMorgan Stanley is coming down,‚Äù wrote Robby Mook in an email to top Clinton aides.Top aide Huma Abedin explained that Hillary would not be happy about it, writing: ‚ÄúHRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. I will have to tell her that [Bill] chose to cancel it, not that we asked.‚Äù Hillary Clinton‚Äôs paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this year‚Äôs primary, were the subject of an email to Podesta. Excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by Clinton‚Äôs research team, including the necessity of having ‚Äúboth a public and a private position‚Äù on issues. It was just part of ‚Äúmaking sausage‚Äù in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. Some ‚Äúflags‚Äù in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs paid speeches were noted in a Jan. 25 email from campaign research director Tony Carrk to top Clinton advisers, including Clinton‚Äôs declaration that ‚ÄúMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.‚Äù Countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù tried to downplay this email by saying it was ‚Äúmostly about trade,‚Äù not immigration, as if the words ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù were never mentioned. But the email exchange also shows how Hillary‚Äôs about-face on the TPP trade deal was mere pandering to Bernie Sanders‚Äô voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. In a speech at Goldman-Black Rock on Feb. 4, 2014, Carrk pointed out, Clinton admitted she‚Äôs ‚ÄúKind Of Far Removed‚Äù from middle-class struggles due to ‚ÄúThe Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy.‚Äù Clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to Wall Street, an issue primary opponent Bernie Sanders continually raised. Clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns. 
Working in tandem with ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô media WND reported Tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for Hillary Clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. Univision Chairman Haim Saban urged the Clinton campaign to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. The Boston Globe tried to time a Clinton opinion piece to do the most good in New Hampshire. CNBC‚Äôs John Harwood urged Clinton campaign chairman Podesta to watch out for then-GOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Democratic National Committee official and CNN contributor Donna Brazile apparently tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potentially difficult CNN town-hall question on capital punishment during the Democratic Party primary season. Brazile adamantly denies it . In a July 2015 email, New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich appeared to ask permission from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. Palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference Clinton made to Sarah Palin and delete Clinton‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúAnd gay rights has moved much faster than women‚Äôs rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon.‚Äù CNBC correspondent John Harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to Donald Trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the Clinton campaign, emailing Podesta with the subject line ‚ÄúWatch out.‚Äù The warning was regarding GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who ‚Äúcould give you real trouble in a general (election).‚Äù Maggie Haberman, a former Politico reporter who now works for the New York Times, was described in a January 2015 memo as having ‚Äúa very good relationship‚Äù with the Clinton campaign. ‚ÄúWe have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed,‚Äù the memo said. 
Demeaning Catholics Podesta discussed fomenting ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù in the Catholic Church with a progressive activist while Hillary‚Äôs now-communications director Jennifer Palmieri mocked Catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,‚Äù Sandy Newman, president and founder of the nonprofit Voices for Progress, wrote Podesta in February 2012 . The email, among the third batch released by WikiLeaks, was titled ‚Äúopening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.‚Äù Podesta tells Newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.‚ÄúWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this,‚Äù the Clinton campaign chairman writes. ‚ÄúBut I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.‚Äù Clinton, who has accused Trump of praising Putin, called the Russian leader in a 2014 speech ‚Äúengaging‚Äù and ‚Äúa very interesting conversationalist.‚Äù Excerpts from Clinton‚Äôs speeches were contained in a document emailed to Podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. 
Collusion with DOJ Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clinton‚Äôs work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clinton‚Äôs campaign. Fallon wrote that ‚ÄúDOJ folks‚Äù told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, Podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. Lawyers also told the Clinton campaign in emails that Hillary‚Äôs private email scandal ‚Äú smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I‚Äôve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc .‚Äù 
Entanglements with foreign governments King Muhammad IV of Morocco made a $12 million pledge to fund the Clinton Global Initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. Hillary‚Äôs top aide, Huma Abedin, wrote in a January 2015 email that ‚Äúif HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.‚Äù Then she warned: ‚ÄúShe created this mess and she knows it.‚Äù Hillary ended up not attending but her husband Bill did. An email from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs account to Podesta on Aug. 17, 2014, said Saudi Arabia and Qatar were ‚Äúproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.‚Äù Critics have pointed out that the Clinton Foundation has received considerable funding from the two Middle East nations. In a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Hillary said Jordan and Turkey ‚Äúcan‚Äôt possibly vet all those refugees so they don‚Äôt know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.‚Äù Two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. largely from United Nations refugee camps in Jordan. 
Insider‚Äôs insider had sway over DNC A WikiLeaks email dump on July 22 revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used her position as head of the DNC to work in concert with the Clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. Schultz was forced to resign over the emails. Issues used to undermine Sanders‚Äô campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. The Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries. ‚ÄúThe Clintons won‚Äôt forget what their friends have done for them,‚Äù wrote Robby Mook, who later became Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager, in the November 2014 email to Podesta."	bias

Democratic Party officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, are categorically denying that pro-Democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voter‚Äôs absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, or FCDC. 
Earlier this week, Jena and David Jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. (See images of the materials Jena and David say they found at the end of this article. Also included are two images from Democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters.) 
‚ÄúI found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and ‚Äòhelp keep Virginia blue‚Äô this year,‚Äù Jena explained. ‚ÄúThen I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot.‚Äù 
In recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. 
After the report was first published, and shared on Facebook by David Jones, Fairfax County Democratic Committee Executive Director Frank Anderson replied to David‚Äôs post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. 
‚ÄúThese materials were NOT sent in the same envelope as the ballot. The ballot is mailed separately by the Office of Elections. Political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. The two envelopes arrived at the same time,‚Äù commented Anderson. 
That triggered a quick back-and-forth between David Jones and Anderson. 
‚ÄúI hate to tell you but you‚Äôre wrong. All items came in one envelope,‚Äù Jones said. 
Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America‚Äôs independent news network. 
‚ÄúImpossible. That letter came out of my office. We never have access to other people‚Äôs ballots,‚Äù replied Anderson. 
‚ÄúThen it seems those that sent the ballots have access to YOUR letters,‚Äù said Jones. ‚ÄúWho should I believe? You or my lying eyes?‚Äù 
Anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote Democratic Party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. 
‚ÄúI am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. We are a political office and have no business handling anyone‚Äôs ballots. You can believe what you want to believe,‚Äù concluded Anderson. 
The Virginia Department of Elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. But after seeing reports from WND and Radio America, Anderson protested the premise of the story. 
‚ÄúPlease stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim,‚Äù stated Anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the Jones account could not be accurate. 
He shared a photo sent by State Sen. Scott Surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing Democratic Party advocacy. 
In a formal interview, FCDC Communications Adviser Bruce Neilson told WND and Radio America the Jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù said Neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local Democrats. 
‚ÄúVoting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe activity of voting is also a public record. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. We get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. 
‚ÄúThe same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the Fairfax (County) Democratic Committee knows to be Democratic positions on the ballot,‚Äù said Neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. 
Listen to the WND/Radio America interview with Bruce Neilson: 
However, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. 
‚ÄúThat material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials ‚Äì FCDC ‚Äì and our return address in Fairfax, Virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government,‚Äù Neilson said. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a separate mailing. It‚Äôs a separate stamp. It‚Äôs a separate envelope. It‚Äôs very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while you‚Äôre filling in your votes,‚Äù he said. 
Jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. David says it‚Äôs a very clear memory. 
‚ÄúJena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying ‚Äògo vote‚Äô or something of that nature. There was also the return envelope, which I signed,‚Äù David said. 
The coverage of Jena‚Äôs story has also elicited similar stories from two other Fairfax County voters. Both of them commented on Reddit.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have our materials,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. They don‚Äôt go anywhere else.

There are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in Fairfax County, leading David Jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. He accepts the explanation that the Fairfax County Democratic Committee is not responsible for what he and Jena discovered with her ballot. 
‚ÄúI understand Frank‚Äôs comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots.

Neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. 
‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail,‚Äù Neilson said. 
He also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight.

After failed attempts by top Iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nation‚Äôs leading reciter of the Quran and close friend of Ayatollah Khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with ‚Äúadvocating corruption.‚Äù 
Saeed Toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the Quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by Persian Voice of America ‚Äì banned for viewing by Tehran ‚Äì in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by Toosi, reported Al Arabiya. 
In an audio recording, Toosi said that Khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of Iran‚Äôs judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nation‚Äôs quranic institution and the regime. 
It‚Äôs time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. ‚ÄúThe Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades‚Äù is a much-needed dose of truth about the ‚Äúreligion of peace.‚Äù 
One document has Toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù One of the victims ‚Äì a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition ‚Äì claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with Toosi to attend a competition. The mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
All victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. The incidents took place over the past seven years during ‚Äúquranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at ‚Äòspreading the quranic culture‚Äô and to participate in quranic competitions.‚Äù 
Toosi is highly respected as Iran‚Äôs most celebrated reader of the Quran and was previously called an ‚Äúexemplary model to be followed‚Äù by Khamenei, current supreme leader of Iran. He is a permanent guest of Khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during Ramadan. Last May, Toosi was asked to recite verses from the Quran at the opening session of the Shura council, with many of Iran‚Äôs top officials in attendance. 
The students told Persian VOA they had filed charges with the House of Leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a ‚Äúrepentance letter‚Äù from Toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a ‚Äúchanged man.‚Äù 
While Iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. The case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the Islamic Republic. 
According to the reformist Amad News, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. The initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in Toosi now being charged. 
Judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, whom the victims‚Äô audio showed conspiring with Khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regime‚Äôs handling of the case, London Guardian reported. Larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with ‚Äúhostile media‚Äù in the VOA story, ‚Äúso we know who is [loyal] to the revolution and who is not.‚Äù 
The case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. Awad News reports members of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution are planning to ‚Äúassassinate‚Äù Toosi to end the scandal and save the regime‚Äôs reputation. 
Toosi, who has denied the charges against him ‚Äì calling them ‚Äútotal lies‚Äù meant to discredit Iran‚Äôs religious institutions and the ayatollah ‚Äì is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of Iran‚Äôs top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds."	bias

WASHINGTON ‚Äì The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. 
A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls ‚Äì Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. 
So far, the company, Pic-A-Kippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. 
‚ÄúMy kippa (yarmulke) company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more,‚Äù Uri Turk, founder and ‚Äúchief kippa officer,‚Äù told WND. ‚ÄúWe see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas.‚Äù 
Pic-A-Kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami. Turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling Trump and Hillary custom kippas on its site since August, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
‚ÄúOur mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas,‚Äù the company says on its website. 
It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting ‚Äúdaylight between America and Israel.‚Äù 
A number of influential Jewish pro-Trump organizations have emerged, chief among them ‚ÄúJews Choose Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish Democrats For Trump.‚Äù A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 3-1 margin. 
According to Turk, Pic-A-Kippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. Pic-A-Kippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says."	bias

Just in time for the start of the 2016 Major League Baseball World Series, WND Films has acquired the father-son baseball movie, ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero,‚Äù for immediate release on DVD. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that ‚ÄúHero‚Äù is a grand-slam movie that will build up families across America and restore luster to the game,‚Äù said Joseph Farah, WND founder and CEO. 
Starring Burgess Jenkins, of ‚ÄúRemember the Titans‚Äù and ‚ÄúNashville,‚Äù and Gregory Alan Williams, of ‚ÄúMiracles from Heaven,‚Äù this award-winning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home. It also features a powerful music soundtrack by three-time Grammy winner Michael Omartian. 
Get ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero‚Äù now at the WND Superstore! From the producers of ‚ÄúAlone Yet Not Alone,‚Äù the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children. 
According to Dr. Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide, ‚Äú ‚ÄòHero‚Äô is an excellent movie about God turning a man‚Äôs heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father.‚Äù 
Dr. Baehr added, ‚ÄúThe opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it.‚Äù Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller 
‚ÄúHero‚Äù opens with Joe (played by Burgess Jenkins) coaching his son David‚Äôs baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannah‚Äôs funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers; the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly: practice times are limited, coaches can‚Äôt make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù trophy. The beloved American pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. So, Joe starts his own league to turns things around. 
From the director of ‚ÄúIsaiah 9:10 Judgment‚Äù and the producer of ‚ÄúAlone Not Yet Alone‚Äù comes ‚ÄúHero,‚Äù a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship that‚Äôs and set around America‚Äôs pastime, baseball. 
One of the fathers Joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, Mr. Redding (played by Gregory Alan Williams). Redding‚Äôs career mirrors that of Joe. He‚Äôs been offered a big job in Washington, D.C. Like Joe, he‚Äôs lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. In contrast, another Gapper teammate has a father who‚Äôs actually a prison inmate under Redding. Unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules.

What makes ‚ÄúHero‚Äù particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself.

Washington Times reporter Bradford Richardson wrote in his article, ‚ÄúStudy blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players,‚Äù that the Austin Institute, a Texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, ‚ÄúCalled Out at Home,‚Äù which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball.

Richardson writes: 
Kevin Stuart, executive director of the Austin Institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because ‚Äúit takes two to play catch.‚Äù 
There is a ‚Äúlong-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball,‚Äù Mr. Stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the Major Leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as ‚ÄúField of Dreams.‚Äù 
Baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. 
‚ÄúBaseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where what‚Äôs really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you,‚Äù Mr. Stuart said.

eea63efc530f89d0c2ba6db7c038a8572611d254	"Judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary 'Unelected and unaccountable' ... rule on 'their empathetic feelings' Published: 4 mins ago About | | Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print 
A member of the increasingly divided and disputatious Alabama Supreme Court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on ‚Äútheir empathetic feelings‚Äù instead of the law. 
‚ÄúAlabama‚Äôs judges are elected and accountable,‚Äù wrote Justice Tom Parker this week. ‚ÄúFederal judges, as recently noted by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges ‚Ä¶ a case in which ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô on the United States Supreme Court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are ‚Äòunaccountable and unelected.‚Äô 
He pointed out that three of the four dissenting U.S. Supreme Court justices in Obergefell ‚Äúnoted on eight different occasions that the ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô who decided Obergefell were unelected. Chief Justice Roberts said on two occasions that those unelected ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô were, consequently, unaccountable.‚Äù 
Parker previously commented that the ‚Äúfive lawyers‚Äù failed to ‚Äúbase their decision ‚Äòon legal reasoning, history, tradition, the court‚Äôs own rules, or the rule of law, but upon the[ir] empathetic feelings.'‚Äù 
‚ÄúObergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges,‚Äù he said. 
He was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the Obergefell case, which created same-sex ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù nationwide, was announced. 
Moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. They did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear Moore‚Äôs arguments. 
Parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are ‚Äúunelected and unaccountable.‚Äù 
‚ÄúUnelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law,‚Äù Parker warned. ‚ÄúObergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. Before the United States Supreme Court decided Obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the United States. 
Don‚Äôt miss Phyllis Schlafly‚Äôs book, now available autographed at the WND Superstore: ‚ÄúWho Killed The American Family?‚Äù 
‚ÄúBefore Obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. In 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. Of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. Each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable.‚Äù 
He explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in Iowa. 
‚ÄúThe Supreme Court of Iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down Iowa‚Äôs traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. The judges of the Supreme Court of Iowa are appointed by the governor of Iowa. However, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires.‚Äù 
He explained that after the Iowa Legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in April 2009, in ‚Äúa decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of Iowa and held [the law] unconstitutional.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe very next year, three of the judges ‚Ä¶ who had concurred in Varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of Iowa. This was the first time since Iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. The people of Iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law.‚Äù 
Mathew Staver, chairman of of Liberty Counsel, which is representing Moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial system‚Äôs handling of Moore‚Äôs case. 
‚ÄúChief Justice Moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive ‚Äì equal justice under the law. He wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe people of Alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. At every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of Alabama. Never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. We hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. The Court of the Judiciary violated the law when it suspended Chief Justice Moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. Never before under the unanimity requirement of COJ Rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. A sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. This is not right.‚Äù 
Supporters of Moore also have filed an ethics complaint against Lyn Stuart, who has been acting as Alabama‚Äôs chief justice. 
She is accused of ‚Äúviolating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding Chief Justice Roy Moore.‚Äù 
The complaint comes from the Sanctity of Marriage Alabama organization. 
‚ÄúIf the Judicial Inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the Alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on Chief Justice Moore,‚Äù said Tom Ford, a spokesman for the group. 
The complaints, the group said, outline ‚Äúhow acting Chief Justice Lyn Stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.‚Äù 
Parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
Daniel Horowitz , senior editor at Conservative Review, told WND that the nation is going through a ‚Äúsocial transformation without representation.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether it‚Äôs the bureaucrats, whether it‚Äôs the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote,‚Äù he said. 
Horowitz tackles the topic of ‚Äúsocial transformation without representation‚Äù in his book ‚ÄúStolen Sovereignty: How to Stop Unelected Judges From Transforming America.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHow did we get here?‚Äù Horowitz asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúAnd the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. This was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. That is social transformation without representation, which, as Scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first American Revolution.‚Äù 
Same-sex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 5-4 majority made up of Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the late Antonin Scalia opposed it. 
The majority found in the Constitution a right to same-sex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. 
It elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the U.S. Supreme Court majority. 
For one, two of the justices in the majority, Kagan and Ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for same-sex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. Without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. 
They refused. 
Then there was the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs own opinion just two years earlier, in the Defense of Marriage Act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. 
And there also are those who point out that the Constitution doesn‚Äôt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. 
As WND reported , Ginsburg, who voted in favor of same-sex marriage, has performed same-sex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. Justice Elena Kagan also has performed same-sex weddings and promoted ‚Äúgay‚Äù rights at Harvard‚Äôs law school while she was at its helm. 
Critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
The Foundation for Moral Law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. The Foundation explained that Canon 3A(6) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges provides: ‚ÄúA judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.‚Äù 28 U.S.C. sec 455(a) mandates that a justice ‚Äúshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.‚Äù 
Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, author of the New York Times bestseller ‚ÄúThe Harbinger‚Äù and the inspiration behind the ‚ÄúIsaiah 9:10 Judgment‚Äù movie, has criticized the Supreme Court‚Äôs assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. 
At a prayer event in Washington, he said: ‚ÄúThe justices of the Supreme Court took up their seats [in a hearing] on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. That the event should even take place is a sign this is America of [George] Washington‚Äôs warning ‚Ä¶ a nation at war against its own foundation.‚Äù 
Washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation ‚Äúthat disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained.‚Äù 
‚ÄúJustices, can you judge the ways of God? There is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account,‚Äù he warned. 
‚ÄúIf a nation‚Äôs high court should pass judgment on the Almighty, should you then be surprised God will pass judgment on the court and that nation? We are doing that which Israel did on the altars of Baal,‚Äù he said. 
See Jonathan‚Äôs Cahn‚Äôs message at Washington: Man of Prayer event at the Capitol. 
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is calling ‚Äúsame-sex marriage‚Äù an ‚Äúintrinsic evil.‚Äù 
And officials from several counties in Tennessee have adopted statements opposing the Supreme Court. 
WND also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of Washington & Lee, Boston College, Kansas State, Notre Dame, University of Texas, Villanova, Vanderbilt, Hillsdale, University of Nebraska, Catholic University and Regent University issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent creation of ‚Äúsame-sex marriage‚Äù as ‚Äúanti-constitutional and illegitimate.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt cannot ‚Ä¶ be taken to have settled the law of the United States,‚Äù said the statement from the American Principles Project . 
‚ÄúWe call on all federal and state officeholders: To refuse to accept Obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case. To recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions. To pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow Obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons. To open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which Americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in Obergefell.‚Äù"	bias

Dr. Baehr added, ‚ÄúThe opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it.‚Äù Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller 
‚ÄúHero‚Äù opens with Joe (played by Burgess Jenkins) coaching his son David‚Äôs baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannah‚Äôs funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers; the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly: practice times are limited, coaches can‚Äôt make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù trophy. The beloved American pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. So, Joe starts his own league to turns things around.

WND also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of Washington & Lee, Boston College, Kansas State, Notre Dame, University of Texas, Villanova, Vanderbilt, Hillsdale, University of Nebraska, Catholic University and Regent University issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent creation of ‚Äúsame-sex marriage‚Äù as ‚Äúanti-constitutional and illegitimate.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt cannot ‚Ä¶ be taken to have settled the law of the United States,‚Äù said the statement from the American Principles Project . 
‚ÄúWe call on all federal and state officeholders: To refuse to accept Obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case. To recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions. To pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow Obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons. To open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which Americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in Obergefell.‚Äù"	bias

WASHINGTON ‚Äì The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. 
A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls ‚Äì Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. 
So far, the company, Pic-A-Kippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. 
‚ÄúMy kippa (yarmulke) company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more,‚Äù Uri Turk, founder and ‚Äúchief kippa officer,‚Äù told WND. ‚ÄúWe see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas.‚Äù 
Pic-A-Kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami. Turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling Trump and Hillary custom kippas on its site since August, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
‚ÄúOur mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas,‚Äù the company says on its website. 
It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting ‚Äúdaylight between America and Israel.‚Äù 
A number of influential Jewish pro-Trump organizations have emerged, chief among them ‚ÄúJews Choose Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish Democrats For Trump.‚Äù A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 3-1 margin. 
According to Turk, Pic-A-Kippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. Pic-A-Kippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says."	bias

When Judith Gait met ‚ÄúFather X,‚Äù it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Gait is a married mother of five, and long-term American resident in Britain. Her support of the pro-life movement is driven by ‚Äúthankfulness and praise‚Äù for life and her Christian faith. 
Witnessing abortion‚Äôs heavy toll on the living and dead, Gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
When a friend first visited Gait‚Äôs studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote: ‚ÄúI realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture.‚Äù 
Gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. Father X remembers every detail. 
Their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book, ‚Äú Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas: Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma .‚Äù Father X wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Gait‚Äôs 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. 
Time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, Gait claims. Rather, ‚Äúthe past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated.‚Äù You can see that in the words of Father X, which run the gamut of human emotions. ‚ÄúOn Abortion: Shoe, Pot and Crosses‚Äùfrom ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äù 
‚ÄúJonah of Nineveh‚Äù features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are ‚Äúalready in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born.‚Äù Torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a child‚Äôs DNA helix and the ‚Äúveil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation.‚Äù Father X makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing ‚Äúparental responsibility‚Äù and eventual redemption ‚Äì then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness: ‚ÄúIt was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear. ‚Ä¶‚Äù 
In some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Father X interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. In ‚ÄúHammer of Decision,‚Äù it belongs to Thor, the war god ‚Äúinfested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction.‚Äù Wagner, the Olympics, ‚Äúsperm races,‚Äù Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenter‚Äôs ‚Äúhammer of wisdom‚Äù or Thor‚Äôs ‚Äútool of chaos‚Äù will be chosen by expectant parents. ‚ÄúHammer, Suspended‚Äù 
‚Äú Troubadours ‚Äù runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, ‚Äúinterstellar wind-jammers‚Äù and a ‚Äúbaby steamer sailing on children‚Äôs seas,‚Äù among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. 
Father X occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. 
In Gait‚Äôs ‚ÄúPink Rose‚Äù and ‚ÄúStardust,‚Äù we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. Father X takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. He places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. Children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in ‚Äúlow mournful tones‚Äù so as not to disturb their parents. Music is ‚Äúintense, equivalent to the sound created by Hildegard von Bingen (a 12th-century nun and composer). ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
References to Mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. ‚ÄúAll babies jump for Jesus‚Äù in the womb (or in ‚Äúits sack of nibbling yoke‚Äù) writes Father X. Elizabeth‚Äôs child John ‚Äúleapt for joy, just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant,‚Äù he continues. 
Gait addresses the human embryo, finding Biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her ‚ÄúAbbey Target Beginning‚Äù has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually: ‚ÄúThe first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread ‚Äì the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Mary‚Äôs womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeth‚Äôs house.‚Äù 
Post-abort guilt isn‚Äôt rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Father X describes bats as whirling about ‚Äúin circles at the pitiful sound the [aborted] children make‚Äù because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are ‚Äústill stone deaf‚Äù to such mournful sounds. At another point, Father-X imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
Father X elaborates on what Gait hints in her paintings: the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christ‚Äôs advent, and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christ‚Äôs gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. 
Ruminating on Gait‚Äôs ‚ÄúPalms of our Lord,‚Äù Father X claims ‚Äúthe face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. ‚ÄúPalms‚Äù is murky, with a single, red hand print. ‚ÄúTo look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins,‚Äù he continues. 
‚ÄúSuicide‚Äù advances this dark theme, where Gait and Father X criticize the death industry and it‚Äôs euphemistically named ‚Äúclinics.‚Äù He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart.‚Äù 
But all isn‚Äôt baleful and sad here. In ‚ÄúCloud Children,‚Äù Father X muses on paper dolls in Gait‚Äôs paintings with this lovely thought: ‚ÄúWhere children go ‚Ä¶ is a mystery. ‚Ä¶ Some say they take their daytime rest in Christ‚Äôs tomb in Jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.‚Äù 
‚Äú Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas ‚Äù is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. Father X may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Gait and Father X describe their efforts as a ‚Äúsilent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those Phantoms of Sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion.‚Äù They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. 
Judith Gait is a graduate of California College of Arts and Crafts and received a Masters at Oxford‚Äôs Ruskin School of Fine Drawing. Her work is in public and private collections in America and abroad. She is an American citizen, residing in Britain. Father X is an addictions counselor and writer in Great Britain, who prefers to remain anonymous.

References to Mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. ‚ÄúAll babies jump for Jesus‚Äù in the womb (or in ‚Äúits sack of nibbling yoke‚Äù) writes Father X. Elizabeth‚Äôs child John ‚Äúleapt for joy, just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant,‚Äù he continues. 
Gait addresses the human embryo, finding Biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her ‚ÄúAbbey Target Beginning‚Äù has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually: ‚ÄúThe first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread ‚Äì the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Mary‚Äôs womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeth‚Äôs house.‚Äù 
Post-abort guilt isn‚Äôt rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Father X describes bats as whirling about ‚Äúin circles at the pitiful sound the [aborted] children make‚Äù because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are ‚Äústill stone deaf‚Äù to such mournful sounds. At another point, Father-X imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
Father X elaborates on what Gait hints in her paintings: the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christ‚Äôs advent, and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christ‚Äôs gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. 
Ruminating on Gait‚Äôs ‚ÄúPalms of our Lord,‚Äù Father X claims ‚Äúthe face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. ‚ÄúPalms‚Äù is murky, with a single, red hand print. ‚ÄúTo look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins,‚Äù he continues. 
‚ÄúSuicide‚Äù advances this dark theme, where Gait and Father X criticize the death industry and it‚Äôs euphemistically named ‚Äúclinics.‚Äù He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart.‚Äù 
But all isn‚Äôt baleful and sad here. In ‚ÄúCloud Children,‚Äù Father X muses on paper dolls in Gait‚Äôs paintings with this lovely thought: ‚ÄúWhere children go ‚Ä¶ is a mystery. ‚Ä¶ Some say they take their daytime rest in Christ‚Äôs tomb in Jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.‚Äù 
‚Äú Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas ‚Äù is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. Father X may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Gait and Father X describe their efforts as a ‚Äúsilent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those Phantoms of Sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion.‚Äù They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. 
Judith Gait is a graduate of California College of Arts and Crafts and received a Masters at Oxford‚Äôs Ruskin School of Fine Drawing. Her work is in public and private collections in America and abroad. She is an American citizen, residing in Britain. Father X is an addictions counselor and writer in Great Britain, who prefers to remain anonymous.

(Fox News) President Obama‚Äôs high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as ‚Äúwhitelisting‚Äù that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News ‚Äì pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private account was used for government business.
